\chapter{System Development for Machine Translation}

% This chapter is about the tricks I learned when developing
% systems for WMT.

\section{Domain Adaptation}

\subsection{Domain Adaptation with Language Modelling}

% This compares the use of an interpolated language model
% vs an uninterpolated language model trained on the same
% data.

\subsection{Domain Adaptation with Provenance Features}

% This compares the use of no features, provenance features
% and provenance feature union

\section{Training Data Size}

% This should compare less data vs more data for parallel and for
% monolingual data.
% Something interesting to compare is big/small first pass LM (4g, 5g) with/without
% 5g rescoring.
