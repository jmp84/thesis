Statistical machine translation models the translation equivalence
between a natural language and another natural language
with formal language grammars. Popular grammars include
phrase-based grammars and synchronous context-free
grammars.

These grammars are typically extracted and estimated from
a set of word alignments. In this thesis, we first show
how to make the extraction and estimation more robust
by exploiting further word alignment models.

We also show how to extract, store and retrieve efficiently
from very large grammars.

Finally, we demonstrate how to apply the phrase-based translation
paradigm to the string regeneration task, with potential
applications to machine translation.
