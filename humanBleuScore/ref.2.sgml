</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">It was learned at the press conference that departments including the city's price control administration came together to announce the ceiling price.  This was mainly because the price of beef noodles went up by too much, exceeding what ordinary residents can afford.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">"The government action is meant to consider the economic ability of ordinary residents in this area.  We conducted cost research before announcing the ceiling price," said the director of the Price Control Administration of Lanzhou City.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">On the 26th of last month, four Lanzhou City departments, including the Price Control Administration, the Industry and Commerce Administration, and the Health Administration, joined hands in implementing an upper limit for the price of beef noodles in the city, attracting a lot of attention once the news was disclosed.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2">On July 2, Borovkov, lawyer of the Russian oligarch Berezovsky exiled in London, announced that the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation has made a new formal charge accusing his client Berezovksky of "secretly planning a national political coup and attempting to violently take over Russian political authority. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Borovkov pointed out that in April this year, in an interview with a reporter from the British The Guardian, Berezovsky announced that he was prepared to initiate a "palace revolution" in Russia and confirmed that he provided financial support to the right wing elite representatives opposing the policies of the party in power.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Following this, the Investigation Office of the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation launched a criminal investigation against Berezovsky according to article 278 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation,"seizing power through violence."  In the last few days they formally lodged a corresponding indictment with Moscow's Savyolovsky court.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Reports say that in February 2006 the Russian Federation Chief Prosecutors Office issued a criminal indictment against Berezovsky on the same premise that the exiled oligarch confirmed in an interview that he planned to take over political power in Russia by force.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Since Berezovsky has continuously been exiled abroad and could not be extradited, in January 2007 the Russians temporarily terminated investigation of this case.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">On July 2, Russia's Savyolovsky court commenced hearing another criminal case against the exiled oligarch.  The Russian Chief Prosecutors Office accused Berezovsky of embezzling 214000000 Rubles from Aeroflot and laundering 16000000 Rubles.  After hearing the evidence the court decided to adjourn until July 12 when they will launch a court investigation.  In the meantime, they will assign a state defense attorney to the accused.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2">According to US media reports on the 15th, the number of reports in the USA of heart disease and other adverse reactions caused by the anti-diabetes drug Avandia has recently seen a dramatic rise.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The US Food and Drug Administration issued a safety warning in May this year suggesting that diabetes patients use Avandia cautiously, because scientists published a research report in the issue of New England Journal of Medicine published on May 21 that said this blockbuster drug will greatly increase the heart disease incidence rate and death rate of patients.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">As a result, the safety of Avandia came under close scrutiny from doctors and patients.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Statistics show within around one month of issuing the safety warning, the US FDA received 357 reports of adverse reactions caused by Avandia, of those 38 were fatality reports.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Whereas in January and February this year, the FDA received only 50 and 73 reports of adverse reactions respectively.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">These adverse reactions were as minor as blistering and as major as sudden cardiac death.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">However, experts at the US FDA believe that now it is still early to arrive at the conclusion that Avandia is unsafe.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">On July 30, the FDA will hold a hearing concerning the safety of Avandia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Introduced to the market in 1999, Avandia is a kind of insulin sensitizer suitable for the treatment of Type II diabetes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">In the entire world there are about 6000000 diabetes patients who have taken or are taking Avandia.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2">A US Department of Defense official said on the 23rd that due to the Iraq war and the change in the world situation, the U.S. Department of Defense is currently reconsidering its plan, formulated in 2002, to cut the number of US troops posted in Europe by roughly half.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">US media quoted a Department of Defense official saying, because the Iraq war is still in progress and US relations with Russia and Iran have worsened, those at the leadership level of the Department of Defense questioned the viability of the plan to cut troops posted in Europe.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In 2002, the Secretary of Defense at the time, Rumsfeld, announced that before 2012 the US will cut the number of troops posted in Europe from the original 113000 people to 71000 people, in order to build a "smaller but superior" new model army.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">At present, the total military strength of the US Army posted in Europe has already been reduced to 100000 people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">However, in June this year, Chief of Staff Craddock at US European Command Headquarter submitted a report to the current Secretary of Defense Gates, raising doubts about the abovementioned reduction plan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The report said that while the military strength of US troops posted in Europe was being reduced, many of the units were rotated and transferred to fight in Iraq and Afghanistan.  This caused a shortfall in US troops posted in Europe and even made it impossible to carry out cooperation with their European allies as normal.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The report suggested terminating the plan to reduce US troops posted in Europe.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Associated experts in the United States believe that the above phenomenon indicates that the prolonged delay in resolving the Iraq war has already upset the original adjustment plan of the US troops.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2">Staff Report by Cao Jiawei and Zhu Chunbin: On June 18, in a class where Jiangsu province Jingjiang City People's Armed Forces full-time cadres assembled for training, a tutorial course on "Winning the Psychological War under Informationalized Conditions" taught by Lu Yuqing, director of the People's Armed Forces Department from Xilai town, received unanimous acclaim from participating students.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">This is a new change achieved by the People's Armed Force Department of this city through giving their full-time cadre actual pressure appropriate to their positions in an effort to improve their overall quality .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">At the beginning of this year, during a grassroots survey, this People's Armed Forces Department Party Committee discovered that some full-time cadres have worked for a long number of years, held too many posts concurrently and were not putting their main effort into doing People's Armed Forces work.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">For this reason, they adopted centralized training, held meetings instead of lectures, relied on local party schools to perform training and other methods, and periodically carried out training for full-time cadre in an effort to solve such problems as the full-time cadres' narrow sphere of knowledge, singular professional capability, etc.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Based on core work, they boldly assigned duties and increased the pressure on People's Armed Forces full-time cadres, and through on-the-job training improved their work competence.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Meanwhile, they actively coordinated with local organization departments and jointly drew up the "People's Armed Forces Full-time Cadre Achieving Position through Competition Plan."  This clarifies the regulation that the director of the People's Armed Forces Department must enter the party committee leading group at the same grade and may not concurrently hold any other offices.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">A full-time cadre rotation arrangement system was established to promptly rotate and exchange older full-time cadre unable to adapt to grassroots People's Armed Forces work, while those comrades with good overall character and strong work capabilities were given promotions and put to use.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The newly added nametag, rank and seniority insignia, national defense service medals and ribbons, and a re-designed cap badge, chest emblem, collar insignia, epaulettes and brassard have increased the uniform's identification functions and enhanced its aesthetics.</seg>
</p>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2">Staff Report by Xue Bingjian and Correspondent Xu Yeqing: The phenomenon of difficult organization, few resources, and individual operation in educating the "small, scattered, remote and direct" units will become a thing of the past at a Second Artillery base.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">In recent days, this reporter learned that after half a year of trials, this base issued "Methods of Implementing the 'Ideological and Political Education Syllabus'" to the grassroots levels.  A number of ideological and political education coordination sections covering all the "small, scattered, remote and direct" units at the base were officially set in operation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">To promote effective implementation of the "Ideological and Political Education Syllabus," at the beginning of the year, this base used their organizational abilities to conduct an in-depth investigation into the current situation of ideological and political education in "small, scattered, remote and direct" units at the base.  They combed through the key problems affecting and restricting education time, staff and effectiveness, and preliminarily formed this kind of new education format of coordination sections for "small, scattered, remote and direct" units.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The specific modus operandi of the coordination section is to break down unit organization boundaries, specify a brigade or regiment level unit to take the lead in a region with relatively concentrated "small, scattered, remote and direct" units in unified planning of topical education.  Units having different subordinate relationships either attend classes nearby together or hold remote discussions by way of a video system.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">A combined method of giving classes in rotation and competing for posts is adopted to unify allocation of educational strength.  Educational hardware in parts of a region was used jointly; and the information, data and educational experiences of all units were shared and exchanged.  Typical reporting tours in parts of the region are periodically organized, and officers and soldiers exchange what they have learned.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Each coordination section has established a full-time education liaison and a part-time educational information collector.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">On this basis, each coordination section has also set up systems to seek help on difficult problems, discuss important educational subject matters, report urgent ideological situations, and to test and appraise.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Director of the political department at the base, Zhang Shengmin, told reporters that establishing political education coordination sections has not only reduced wastage of educational resources, but has also deepened the effect of the education.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Some politics instructors were afraid to lose points in front of officers and men from other units, so they took the initiative to learn new knowledge and seek out new methods of education.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The officers and men receiving education also actively digested the educational content lest they sounded unprofessional in front of officers and men from neighboring units in their discussions and analyses.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">In so doing, the enthusiasm of the educators and the educated has been both effectively stirred up.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">After the hearing, the official FIA website issued a statement saying, "The Vodafone McLaren Mercedes team was in possession of confidential Ferrari information, but there is currently insufficient evidence to prove that this information was improperly used for the FIA Formula One World Championship.  We'll therefore impose no penalty."</seg>

<p>
<seg id="4">However, the Ferrari technology spy case does not end with this.</seg>

<seg id="3">According to a China Securities Journal report, with the introduction of the Provisional Measures for Administration of Outbound Investment of Insurance Funds a few days ago, insurance funds have more space to utilize the capital markets.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Liu Lefei, chief investment officer of China Life Insurance Co. Ltd., believes that with Renminbi appreciation and positive trends in domestic capital markets, insurance institutions in the near future will not make large-scale overseas investments with foreign exchange purchases.  This also indicates that QDII insurers will not divert domestic stock market capital in the near future.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The report said that many insurance institutions share the same view.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Experts believe that as there is currently no market for Renminbi derivatives, insurance institutions have insufficient means of avoiding risk.  As a result, it is not time yet for large-scale foreign exchange purchases.</seg>

<seg id="7">Liu Lefei said that in terms of capital allocation, outbound investment should make up a certain ratio of overall allocations for insurance companies in the long run.</seg>

He claimed he hopes that this phenomenon does not exist in Taiwan, but that it might be very difficult.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">(June 28, China Youth Daily)</seg>

<seg id="4">In law, there is the "theoretical field" and the "practical field."  The former mainly includes "abstract actions" such as legal teaching and research work, while the latter undertakes more "concrete actions" such as litigation, legal consultation, and legal services.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">For a long time, "intellectual disparagement" has existed between the "theoretical field" and "practical field" of law.  The "theoretical field" thinks that the "practical field" lacks necessary accomplishment in the law and are only mechanical "legalists"; meanwhile, the response of the "practical field" to criticism by the "theoretical field" is "theory cannot guide practice."</seg>

<seg id="6">Concerning this kind of division of labor gap, what the law can do is stay neutral instead of giving strong support to either side.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The fact is that some experts and scholars who are engaged in researching and teaching of pure legal theory, such as history of the legal system and international law, do not fit with practical law regardless of their depth of theoretical attainment.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">After entering, there is more of this kind of situation.  No matter how good your mood, you will be bothered to the point of losing interest.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="10">Media have reported that many foreign tourists in Xi'an sing endless praise for the scenic spots and historic sites of Xi'an, but cannot understand why masses of small peddlers and hawkers are allowed to sell everywhere.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Peddlers' freedom to come and go not only affects the mood of tourists, it also destroys the public order of these public places on an objective level, bringing about visual pollution and environmental pollution.  At the same time, it also gives lawless people the condition and opportunity for creating trouble.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="14">Just think, you want to make the tourism industry bigger and stronger, but use this kind of chaotic tourism environment to welcome guests from near and far.  Who still wants to come?  Who dares to come?</seg>

<seg id="1">"Rewarding Self-Initiated Exit from Subsistence Allowances" Does not Pass Muster</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2">The Jianguomen neighborhood in Dongcheng District, Beijing, gave items such as refrigerators as a reward to 12 poor families who exited from subsistence allowances on their own initiative.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">(Beijing News, July 10)</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">This writer feels happy for the improved lives of these families, but has mixed feelings about the phrase "self-initiated exit from subsistence allowances," and the practice of "giving rewards."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">An assistant director of the Jianguomen neighborhood said, "In light of problems like cheating on subsistence allowances, encouraging the self-initiated exit from subsistence allowances sets an example for other poor families."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">This example is indeed worth promoting if it encourages other poor people to get out of their predicaments through one's own hard work; it is really somewhat naïve if it is thought this will "inspire" those people who have fraudulently received subsistence allowances for a long time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">When differentiating and straightening out real and fake poor families, what should be relied on more is the law.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Relevant departments should strengthen the obligations that must be met for poor families to enjoy subsistence allowances: such as immediately reporting changes in family members' incomes, reporting employment situation, and accepting regular reviews.  Meanwhile, relevant departments should increase the strength of supervision and investigation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">In the end, "exit from subsistence allowance according to the law" is the long-term solution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Who pays when the neighborhood gives material rewards to families who exit from subsistence allowance?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">As a first-level governmental organization, a neighborhood has its expenses covered by financial allocations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">However, should this taxpayer money be spent?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">On the one hand, families who exit from subsistence allowances prove that they already have a certain "self-sufficient" capacity; on the other hand, aren't there still people who are applying for subsistence allowances?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Government financial allocations, which is called a lifeline, should provide timely help rather than reward good fortune.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">On July 10, Chengdu City Xindu District Mulan Town Party Committee Secretary Liu Gangyi, the first town party committee secretary in the country to be directly elected by the public, received his fourth review since taking office, achieving a satisfaction rate of 97%.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Liu Gangyi positioned himself as a "service provider" during a conversation between this correspondent and Liu Gangyi.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">(Yesterday, Beijing News)</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">"Service provider" in the words of Liu Gangyi may be more real, more convincing than "service provider" in the words of some appointed cadres.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The biggest advantage of being directly elected by the public compared to appointment is that for the former, determination of power mainly originates with ordinary party members and the public, whereas for the latter, nominations are mainly by superior organizations.  Therefore, direction of the power source determines that with the former, responsibility to the public must be given top priority.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The source of power, and to whom one owes responsibility, are basic elements that determine how elected people carry out their work.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">My opinion is, having this kind of "democratic review" format is better than nothing.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="10">Considering the history and current situation of China's grassroots democratic political development, I think direct election by the public is already a major breakthrough.

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2">On June 23, Patil clasped her hands together before filling out the presidential candidate documents.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">India's presidential election kicked off on the 19th, with the new president to be elected from between Shekhawat, the current vice president, and Pratibha Patil, the recently resigned governor of Rajasthan state.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2">From this year, every department in each region of Guangxi has launched a campaign to change the working style of cadres and intensify construction of administrative efficiency in its organizations.  It implements "three systems:" the initial enquiry responsibility system, the handling formalities within time limits system, and the responsibility accountability system.  The key examination and approval departments affiliated to 33 autonomous regions and 135 positions of responsibility were brought into the administrative efficiency supervision work network.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Up until now, 619 people have been called to account.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">On the 5th, this correspondent learned from the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Committee for Discipline Inspection that at present Guangxi has preliminarily formed a three tier, autonomous region, municipal and county administrative efficiency inspection work network to intensify supervision of the key departments and positions of responsibility.  An electronic monitoring system of 14 cities has been fully implemented in the autonomous region's network.</seg>

This has further standardized the conducting of examinations and approvals, as well as improved its efficiency.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">At the same time, all levels of discipline inspection and monitoring organizations in Guangxi are strictly investigating and dealing with cases involving work style and efficiency, and damage to the public interest.  Up until now, a total of 1104 cases have been verified and investigation results for 769 cases have been finalized; 584 work units and 619 people have been called to account.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Member of the standing committee of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Party Committee and Discipline Inspection Committee Secretary Ma Tieshan said on the 5th that administrative efficiency inspection is an item of work that will always remain concomitant with administrative activities and must be progressively formed into a longstanding and effective mechanism.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Guangxi must further perfect and standardize codes of practice for each item of administrative management, build a complete administrative efficiency monitoring work system and safeguarding mechanism, and bring efficiency monitoring on track of systemization and standardization.  It must further regulate monitoring and inspection procedures, build a complete complaint handling and performance efficiency evaluation and assessment mechanism, and significantly increase accountability efforts by using a strict accountability system to ensure that the initial enquiry responsibility system, the handling formalities within time limits system and other work systems are put fully into practice.</seg>

<seg id="2">Xinhua News Agency, Riga, July 12 (Correspondent Yang Dehong) The German Foreign Minister Steinmeier, visiting Latvia on the 12th, called on the Russians to pass the Latvia-Russia border treaty as soon as possible.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">That day, Steinmeier and Latvian Foreign Minister Pabriks held a meeting together.  Both parties primarily discussed Latvian-German relations, Latvian and EU cooperation, and other issues.  They also exchanged opinions and perspectives on the development of Latvian-Russian relations and EU-Russian relations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">At the press conference held after the meeting, Steinmeier called on the Russians to pass the Latvia-Russia border treaty as soon as possible.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Steinmeier said that the pace of improvement in relations between Latvia, all the Baltic Sea States, and Russia is relatively slow.  Signing of the Latvia-Russia border treaty testifies to the course of development of Latvian-Russian relations, but the "shadow of history" also may possibly cause Latvian-Russian relations to regress again and he hopes the Russian side can pass the Latvia-Russia border treaty as early as possible in order to expedite forward development of relations between the two countries.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="6">On March 27 this year, after as long as ten years of negotiations, Latvian Prime Minister Kalvitis and Russian Prime Minister Fradkov signed a bi-national border treaty in Moscow.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">Staff report, Berlin, July 1 (Correspondent Wang Huaicheng)</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">German Education and Research Minister Schavan said a few days ago that Germany should lower the Immigration Law restrictions on bringing in foreign specialized skilled workers, using an introduction of foreign talent to solve Germany's specialized skilled worker shortage problems.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">According to an OECD report, by 2010, Germany's labor force between 15 and 64 years old will be shrinking yearly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Without enough immigrants, Germany's labor force by 2020 will be 6% smaller than now.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">However, reports from organizations such as the Federation of German Employers' Associations and the Association for German Engineers show that there is a relatively large shortage in the current German labor market for engineers and specialized technology workers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">According to data from the German Federal Labor Agency, the German labor market had a supply shortage of about 12700 engineers and a supply shortage of about 9600 technicians in May of this year.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Germany has set high barriers for the introduction of foreign skilled workers in order to protect local employment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Germany's Immigration Law states that specialized skilled workers from non-EU countries cannot earn less than € 85500 per year in Germany, or else cannot obtain German work and residency permits.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2">On July 1, the alarm bell at Jinghai temple memorial hall in Nanjing was once again struck and rung with a melodious resound.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">This echo of profound historical significance "connected" the Mainland and Hong Kong through television; citizens of Nanjing and their fellow countrymen in Hong Kong "shared this moment with the entire world" together celebrating the 10th anniversary of Hong Kong's handover to the motherland.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">At midnight on July 1 ten years ago, the air above the bell tower at Jinghai temple memorial in Nanjing reverberated to the sounds of one hundred and fifty-five strikes of the alarm bell.  It was saying adieu to the humiliating history of the cession of Hong Kong Island.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Outside the entrance to the small memorial hall, people from all walks of society in Nanjing gathered together.  They said they will use their own two hands to strike this alarm bell, to warn themselves and later generations never to forget history.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The alarm bell is 1.842 meters high and it was in 1842 that the "Nanjing Treaty" was signed, right at the time the Opium War broke out.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The shoulder of the bell is 1.997 meters high and 1997 is the year of the Hong Kong handover.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The planner and founder of the alarm bell that year, Wang Fengling, explained, "Five rows of the character '10000' encircle the body of the bell.  The entire bronze bell uses high relief sculpture and two dragons support a ball of fire which symbolizes that Hong Kong is the motherland's 'Pearl of the Orient.'  Finally, the flower of Nanjing city, plum blossom, is the figure on the bell's strikeplate."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The first member of the Democracy Party that year to propose making the alarm bell, Yu Xiaodong, said emotionally, "Before I realized it, it is already ten years since Hong Kong's return."  He hopes that Hong Kong's tomorrow can be like the sound of the bell, "bright and long, and stretching forever without end."</seg>

<seg id="3">Report by Qu Yimao and Yang Ruiyu: "We are able to live in an apartment thanks to the resolve and determination of the Battalion Party Committee to clear out the rooms."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Today, more than ten cadres from a communication training battalion in Chengdu Military Command all look very happy as they move to an apartment block .  They are full of admiration and appreciation at the style in which "the team" of the Battalion Party Committee dared to stick to their guns and struggle against obstacles to resolve a thorny problem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">In the last few years, as personnel have been replaced, a portion of this battalion's apartments in this family dormitory building was over-occupied, contrary to regulations, which made it difficult for cadres in service to find accommodation.  Officers and men have expressed considerable objections concerning this matter.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The battalion also cleared out the apartments several times before, but due to resistance they settled the matter by leaving it unsettled, which turned this issue into a long-standing problem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">"If only one sticks to one's guns and is fair and reasonable, there are no unsolvable problems."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">After the new party committee team achieved consensus, major leaders came out in person to set about completely clearing up all the problems where apartments were occupied contrary to regulations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">On the one hand, they appealed to people's emotion and explained through reason, hoping that the people concerned would consider the overall situation; on the other hand they explained clearly the related policies and regulations on military apartments, pooled housing and economic housing, and made clear the party committee's determination, resolve and standpoint on principles.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">For some people with housing elsewhere yet unwilling to withdraw from over-occupied housing, the party committee promptly contacted their work unit and took corresponding steps to urge them to actively cooperate with the army's work.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">After two months of painstaking work, all the residents of buildings on the campgrounds that were over-occupied against regulations moved out on schedule and the serving battalion cadres were allotted housing according to regulations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">This style in which the Battalion Party Committee dares to stick to its guns and struggle against obstacles also created a domino effect: a few cadres originally unwilling to actively cooperate with the organization's allocation, now also, one by one, expressed submission to the organization's decision.</seg>

<seg id="1">(Sports) For Beijing Olympic Games, Flower Season Altered for Flowers to Bloom in "Wrong Season"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2">Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 28 (Correspondent Cui Junqiang) When next year's Olympics are held, Beijing in August, with its high temperature and humidity, is expected to transform into a sea of fresh flowers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">By employing technology to change the flower season, and other measures, scientific researchers have found a good strategy to add color to the Olympic Games.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">At the "Summer Olympics Optimal New Flower Variety Selection and Cultivation Applications Research" project acceptance meeting held on the 28th in Beijing, assessment experts arrived at the conclusion that the use of new technology to spur and control flower cultivation will enable different flower types or varieties with different natural flower seasons to bloom in the same time in the summer, thus the best visual effect will be achieved in August when the Beijing Olympic Games will be held .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">In the Beijing summer, often only a dozen or so types of blooming flowers can be seen.  The majority of flowers have either already withered or are still a long time away from their buds opening.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Through their endeavors, scientific researchers chose 206 types and over 400 varieties of the most optimal flowers for the Summer Olympics.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">At the "2007 Olympics Flower Exhibition" to be held in Haidian Park, Beijing, around the one year countdown to the Beijing Olympic Games opening, a batch of fresh and bright-colored flowers carefully cultivated by scientific researchers, that in the past have been unable to naturally bloom in August, will welcome visitors.</seg>
