Nearly 500 People Dead in Monsoon Floods in India
According to reports from officials and the media, the number of people who have died this year in India because of heavy monsoon rains has risen to 474.
The Press Trust of India quoted the government minister for relief and rehabilitation Kadam as revealing today that in the last week, the monsoon has started in all of India's states one after another, and that the financial losses and casualties have been serious in all areas.  Just in Maharashtra, the state which includes Mumbai, India's largest city, the number of people known to have died has now reached 358.
Reports say that Kadam made the above statement to media and journalists as he was making an inspection of Mumbai.
He said that Maharashtra, which is also India's biggest cotton-producing state, was entirely covered with a vast expanse of water, and there were cities and towns numbering 27 and about 2000 villages which had been hit by serious flooding.  More than 10000 affected people had been evacuated to safe shelters.
The whole of India, from south to north, started to progressively enter the monsoon season a week ago.  The residents of each state all greeted the heavy rains as relief at the end of a long drought, but didn't expect that the rain would come with unexpected violence, a real deluge.  Highways have become rivers; houses in low-lying areas have been surbmerged in the water; the transport system is nearly paralyzed.  To date, figures show that nearly 500 people have unfortunately lost their lives to the floods.
Wimbledon Tennis Tournament: Djokovic Forfeits, Nadal Through to Final
Spanish clay court master Nadal today played Serbian wizard Djokovic in the men's singles semi-finals of the Wimbledon championships.  At the end of the match, Djokovic was unable to continue to play because he was injured, forfeited and withdrew from the match.  Nadal won and entered the final.  He will replay the titanic struggle for the championship at the French Open against the Swiss king of the tennis world, Federer.
Djokovic called for medics to treat his back injury during the course of both his last-16 and quarter-final matches.  Today, when he had played to the third set, he again called for a medic to treat him because of a blister on his toe.  He later felt that he could not play on with the injury and decided to forfeit the game.
Fourth seed Djokovic's withdrawal from the game allowed second seed Nadal, who was leading 3-6, 6-1, 4-1, to claim the victory and progress through.
Apart from losing the first set after being broken once due to a slow start at the beginning of the match, Nadal was in a leading position throughout the second and third sets.
UN Envoy Calls Nuclear Talks, Iran's Attitude Still Inflexible
UN International Atomic Energy Agency deputy director-general Heinonen today held talks with Iranian officials in Tehran, once again trying to break the deadlock created by Iran's nuclear plans.
But Iranian President Ahmadinejad remained defiant under increasing pressure from the UN's further sanctions.
Ahmadinejad asserted that Iran will not stop uranium enrichment, but welcomed these new talks.
He said: "Progress towards the installation of centrifuges can be delayed or speeded up.  This is an administrative issue.  But no-one should expect us to give up our rights.  We will not stop this progress."
He made this remark after Heinonen arrived in Tehran.
Heinonen's aim on this trip is to establish a plan to resolve "the outstanding issues" caused by Iran's nuclear plans.
The UN has already imposed two sets of sanctions on Iran because Tehran failed to freeze its uranium enrichment operation.
The Islamic Republic News Agency reports that Heinonen held talks with officials led by Vaeedi, deputy secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council for International Affairs.
The members of Iran's delegation at the talks also included Saeedi, vice-president of the Atomic Energy Organization, and Soltaniyeh, permanent ambassador to the IAEA.
State of Emergency Period Ends; Palestinian Prime Minister Fayyad to Form New Government
The month-long state of emergency declared by the Palestinian authorities after Hamas militants occupied the Gaza Strip comes to an end today.  Prime Minister Fayyad offered resignation temporarily, but was immediately ordered to take responsibility for forming a new government.
Minister for Agriculture and Social Affairs Habbash told AFP: "Prime Minister Fayyad offered his resignation to President Abbas.  The president accepted it and at the same time also asked him to form a new cabinet government to be responsible for routine administration."
Amr, an advisor to Abbas, told AFP that Fayyad had tendered his resignation, but that Abbas had ordered him to "act in his current position until he has formed a new government."
The resignation of Fayyad, who is a highly respected economist, was merely a procedural resignation, and will not affect his position as prime minister.
Fayyad has led Palestine's emergency cabinet since the 17th of last month, being responsible for executing Abbas's state of emergency decree after Hamas's violent occupation of Gaza.
According to the basic law of the Palestinian self-rule government, a state of emergency cannot exceed 30 days without the agreement of the parliament, but the autonomous parliament is currently paralyzed.
The emergency government's authority expires today.

Lanzhou Price Bureau Gives Explanation of Price Controls on Beef Noodles: It's Only Because the Rises have been Too Large
Chinanews.com, Lanzhou, July 10 (Huang Dang)
This afternoon, the Lanzhou municipal price bureau invited the departments concerned and held a seminar on the price controls on beef noodles.
This reporter learned at the meeting that the main reason that the price bureau and other departments of this city have jointly issued an upper price limit is that the rise in the price of beef noodles has been too large, and has gone beyond what most residents can cope with.
It is said that the rate of this rise in the price of beef noodles has reached 20%.  According to statistics, this is the largest rise in the shortest time since the first time the price of beef noodles rose in Lanzhou in the early 80s of the last century.
"Government actions must take ordinary local people's spending power into consideration.  The upper price limit we have issued is based on a survey of costs," said the head of the Lanzhou municipal price bureau.
On the 26th of last month four departments, including the Lanzhou municipal price bureau, industry and commerce administration, and health department, jointly imposed an upper price limit on the price of beef noodles in this city.  As soon as news was made public, it attracted intense attention.
It is understood that this seminar was aimed at listening to a wide range of opinions from all sectors, and seeking opinions and suggestions on issuing further specific measures.  It was also revealed that Lanzhou will hold a press conference tomorrow.
This will be the second press conference that Lanzhou Municipality has held on the incident of rises in the price of beef noodles.

Wang Yan's Injury Condition Improves as She "Maintains" Seated Posture on Bench and Her Arm Strength Recovers by "Two Points"
"Wang Yan can now sit up on a bench, but still not for too long, otherwise she feels dizzy," Zhejiang Sports Bureau gymnastics center director Wu Xiqin told reporters yesterday.
Prior to this, the condition of Wang Yan, who was injured in competition, had been steadily improving.  The recovery of strength in her left and right arms had improved by "two points" compared to over ten days before.
On the 4th of this month, when Wang Yan was transferred from the ICU (intensive care unit) of Shanghai's No. 6 Hospital to a special-needs ward, the strength in her right arm was 2-3 points, and the strength in her left arm was 1 point.
After nearly half a month, the strength in Wang Yan's arms has further improved.
"The doctors say that the strength in Wang Yan's right arm has reached more than 4, just one point lower than the normal score of 5.  The strength in her left arm is also over 3," said Wu Xiqin.
That is to say, in less than half a month's time, Wang Yan's arm strength has recovered by "two points."
A while before, with the help of doctors, Wang Yan was able to remain sitting in bed for five minutes.
The hospital's rehabilitation specialist had originally planned to have Wang Yan start doing touch down exercises within the protection of a rehabilitation bed at the end of last week.
But given Wang Yan's recovery at the present stage, the floor rehabilitation exercises had to be postponed for the time being.
Wu Xiqin said that Wang Yan's current exercises mainly focused on "sitting."  "She can maintain a seated posture on a bench for a while, but still not for too long."  (Correspondent Wang Chunqiu)

He said there will be major cuts in the salaries of high-level civil servants.
He also said that if any foreigners who came to Venezuela attacked the Venezuelan government, they would face severe consequences and would be deported.

He also said in his speech that there will be major cuts in the salaries of high-level civil servants.
He said the highest salary for a civil servant in Venezuela must not exceed US $ 7000 per month.
It is learned that in Venezuela, the monthly income of some poor people is US $ 250.
Cutting the salaries of civil servants has become a trend in Latin American countries and has gained widespread approval among the public.
The leaders of Peru, Bolivia and other countries have all cut their own pay.
Chavez also said that Cuban leader Castro had reminded him to watch out for assassination commanded by the US.
He said that Castro had presented him with a memoir written by Tenet, a former head of the US Central Intelligence Agency, and asked him to have a look at various CIA's "secrets that cannot be told to anyone."
US Supports Pakistani Government in Ousting Extremists
Staff Writer, Washington, July 22 (Correspondent Xu Qisheng)
US President Bush said on the 21st that the US will fully support the Pakistani government in driving al Qaeda and Taliban extremists out of the border region between Pakistan and Afghanistan.
In his regular weekly radio address that day, Bush said that according to the latest US intelligence, al Qaeda has found a "safe haven" in the area of Pakistan bordering Afghanistan.
He expressed "serious concern" over this.
Bush said that the US will continue to support Pakistani President Musharraf, believing that Musharraf will persistently fight against al Qaeda and Taliban militants.
It is noted in the National Intelligence Estimate report recently released by the US that Islamic militant organizations, Bin Laden's al Qaeda in particular, still constitute a persistent threat to the US.
The agreement reached by Musharraf and some tribal leaders in the northern region of Pakistan last September on guarding against the remnant forces of the Taliban and activities of al Qaeda members has failed to achieve the expected result.
These tribal leaders "were unwilling or unable" to maintain the security of the region on their own.
In this prerecorded address, Bush said that Musharraf is taking active steps to correct this mistake.

At the press conference held that day, Hill said that in order to achieve the goal of completely resolving the North Korea nuclear issue in 2008, it is necessary that North Korea declare its entire nuclear program and disable its nuclear facilities by the end of this year.
He hopes that all relevant parties can fully implement the agreement reached at the six-party talks on the North Korea nuclear issue within a year.
In addition Hill said that while holding talks on security and energy resources issues, the US-North Korea and Japan-North Korea working groups will also respectively discuss the outstanding issues in the bilateral relations between the US and North Korea as well as Japan and North Korea.
Climate Change Leads to Rapid Shrinking of Alps Glacier
Staff Writer, Geneva, July 29 (Correspondent Liu Jun)
A long-term follow-up research by glacier experts at the Swiss Academy of Sciences found that from 1850 to 2005 the 1800 plus glaciers in Switzerland were shrinking at an annual rate of 3%.
The heat wave in 2003 alone caused the Alps glacier to melt by 1.8%
Experts believe that if the global temperature rises by 3 degrees Celsius by 2100, the glaciers will have shrunk by 80% compared with the present and that with a temperature rise of 5 degrees Celsius, the glaciers will have entirely melted.
The Aletsch glacier is the longest glacier in Europe and has been inscribed on the list of the UNESCO Natural World Heritage.  However, from 2005 to 2006, it shrank by 100 meters within a year.  There can be no more delay in protecting the natural environment.

Russia's Security Service Accuses Exiled Oligarch Berezovsky of "Plotting to Launch a Coup d'Etat"
A lawyer for Berezovsky, the Russian oligarch in exile in London, Borovkov, announced on July 2 that the Russian Federal Security Service had formally issued a new charge against his client, accusing Berezovsky of "plotting to engineer a coup d'état and attempting a violent seizure of political power in Russia."
Borovkov pointed out that in April this year Berezovsky had announced during an interview with a journalist from the British "Guardian" newspaper that he was preparing to launch a "palace coup" in Russia, and confirmed that he was providing financial support to representatives of the right-wing elite opposed to the policies of the administration.
The Russian Federal Security Service's investigation bureau immediately launched a criminal investigation against Berezovsky under article 278 on "forcible seizure of power" of the Penal Code of the Russian Federation, and has formally brought forward related charges in Moscow's Savyolovsky court recently.
It is reported that the Russian Procuratorate-General brought criminal charges against Berezovsky in February 2006, similarly based on the exiled oligarch's confirmation during an interview that he was attempting a seizure of state power by force in Russia.
As Berezovsky has remained in exile abroad, making it impossible to extradite him, Russia authorities temporarily suspended the investigation of the case in January 2007.
On July 2, Moscow's Savyolovsky court began to hear another criminal case against the exiled oligarch.  The Russian Procuratorate-General accused Berezovsky of embezzling funds of 214000000 roubles from Aeroflot and laundering 16000000 roubles.  After the hearing the court decided to postpone judicial investigation into this case till July 12, and a state defense lawyer will be assigned for the defendant in this period.
Berezovsky believes that this is all a "farce," and has explicitly prohibited his defense lawyer from taking part in the court hearings.

Simone de Manso said that NATO is currently studying the US anti-missile program, and hopes that the range protected by the US anti-missile bases will cover all its European allies.
She said that NATO has its own war zone missile defense system and had begun discussions on setting up a strategic missile defense system, and that it would not be impossible to link up the US anti-missile system with NATO's own defense system.
She also said that with respect to the question of the US setting up an anti-missile system in Europe, NATO will exchange information with Russia through many channels in a timely way.

Number of Reports of Adverse Reactions Caused by Diabetic Medicine, Avandia, Increases Sharply
According to a report in the US media on the 15th, there has recently been a trend in the US towards a sharp increase in the number of reports of heart diseases and other adverse reactions caused by Avandia, an anti-diabetic medicine.
In May this year the US Food and Drug Administration issued a safety warning, recommending that sufferers from diabetes exercise caution when using Avandia, because a scientist had published a research report in the edition of the New England Journal of Medicine that came out on May 21, saying that this best-selling drug could greatly increase the incidence of and death rate from heart disease among sufferers.
Consequently, the safety of Avandia has received close attention by doctors and patients.
Statistics show that in the approximately one month following the issuing of the safety warning, the US FDA had received 357 reports of adverse reactions caused by Avandia, of which 38 were reports of deaths.
And yet the FDA had received just 50 and 73 reports of adverse reactions in January and February this year respectively.
These adverse reactions ranged from being as trivial as getting blisters to as serious as sudden deaths from heart disease.
However, the US FDA's pharmaceuticals experts believe that it would currently be premature to reach the conclusion that Avandia is not safe.
The FDA will hold a hearing into the safety of Avandia on July 30.
Avandia, which came on the market in 1999, is an insulin sensitizer, suitable for treating Type 2 diabetes.
Some 6000000 diabetes sufferers worldwide have taken or are taking Avandia.
Avandia's producer, the British company GlaxoSmithKline, continues to believe that Avandia is safe, and that for suffers "the benefits outweigh the drawbacks."
US Wishes to Restart Middle East Peace Talks
US President Bush gave an address on the 16th in Washington, calling for the holding of an international conference on the Palestine-Israel issue this fall, and inviting Israel, Palestine and some of the surrounding Arab countries and other countries concerned to take part, in order to jointly push for the restarting of the Middle East peace process.
On the 17th, Bush also made separate phone calls to Egypt's President Mubarak, Jordan's King Abdullah II, and Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah, asking them to respond positively to this proposal, give practical support to Abbas, the president of the Palestinian National Authority, and help the Palestinians and the Israelis to resume peace talks at an early date.
Abbas Says the PLO Central Committee Will Discuss the Issue of Bringing Forward the Palestinian General Election
The president of the Palestinian National Authority, Abbas, said in Ramallah on the 18th that the two-day conference of the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) Central Committee had been inaugurated on the same day, and that the conference would discuss bringing forward the holding of elections for the Palestinian National Authority and the Legislative Council and other issues.
On the same day Abbas met the EU High Representative for foreign and security affairs, Solana, in the Ramallah Presidential Office, and said at the subsequent joint press conference that if the PLO Central Committee made the relevant resolutions, the president would have the power to issue a "legal, effective" decree, and a decree of this type would be issued quickly.
At the same time, Abbas felt satisfied with relations between the Palestinian National Authority and the EU.
He said that Palestine welcomed the EU's understanding of measures adopted by the Palestinian Presidential Office.
Abbas urged the EU to continue providing humanitarian assistance to the Palestinian people in Gaza.
Solana reaffirmed the EU's support for Abbas as well as the Palestinian people.
He said the four sides involved in the Middle East issue (the UN, the EU, the US and Russia) would convene a conference on the 19th to discuss the issue of restarting the Middle East peace process, and a proposal would probably be put forward in the next few days.
Solana said the EU maintained a positive attitude towards the deployment of international troops in Gaza, but still needed to discuss this with various other parties.  In particular, discussions will need to be held with the UN.

US Department of Defense Reconsiders Plans to Reduce US Troops in Europe
An official in the US Department of Defense said on the 23rd that due to the Iraq war and changes in the world situation, the US Department of Defense is reconsidering a plan drawn up in 2002 to cut the number of US troops in Europe by approximately half.
The US media cited a Department of Defense official as saying that due to the ongoing Iraq war and the worsening US relations with Russia and Iran, Department of Defense leaders have raised doubts about the feasibility of plans to cut troops in Europe.
In 2002 the then Secretary of Defense Rumsfield announced that the US would reduce troop numbers in Europe from the original 113000 to 71000 before 2012, in order to create a new-style army with "fewer, but better" soldiers.
The US army's total forces in Europe have currently fallen to 100000 people.
But in June this year, Commander Craddock of the US Army Headquarters in Europe submitted a report to the current secretary of defense, Gates, raising doubts over the above-mentioned reduction plan.
The report said that while US army forces are being reduced in Europe, many military units would be deployed on a rotation basis to Iraq and Afghanistan for combat, leading to a shortfall in US troops in Europe to such an extent that there would be no way to develop normal cooperation with European allies.
The report recommended halting the plan to reduce US troops in Europe.
Relevant US experts believe that the above-mentioned phenomenon shows that the prolonged and unresolved Iraq war has disrupted the original US military's restructuring plans.

People's Armed Force Department in Jingjiang City Sets up a Platform to Raise the Quality of Their Full-time Cadres
Staff Writer, Report by Cao Jiawei and Zhu Chunbin: On June 18, at a training class for People's Armed Force full-time cadres in Jingjiang city in Jiangsu province, Lu Yuqing, leader of the People's Armed force department of Xilai township, delivered a training lecture "Winning a Psychological War under Informationalized Conditions" that received a unanimous favorable assessment from the trainees.
This was a new change that was brought about by the city's People's Armed Force when it has put more pressure on its cadres based on the reality of their positions in an effort to raise People's Armed Force cadres' comprehensive quality.
At the beginning of this year, the People's Armed force party committee discovered during investigation and research at the grassroots level that some of the People's Armed Force cadres had served for a long time, had too many concurrent duties, and had not put their chief energies into the armed force work.
For this reason, they have adopted methods including centralized training, replacing training with meetings, and relying on local party schools to conduct training, thus regularly training military cadres, in an effort to resolve problems such as the narrow knowledge base and the uniform focus of the professional quality of military cadres.
In combination with the central work, they boldly assign tasks to military cadres and put more pressure on them, and raise their performance by on-the-job training.
At the same time, they have actively coordinated with local organizational departments and jointly drafted the "People's Armed Forces Cadres' Competition for Jobs Scheme," and explicitly stipulated that the leaders of People's Armed Forces departments must join the party committee of the same level and cannot concurrently take on other jobs.
They have set up a military cadres' restructuring exchange mechanism to promptly regulate exchanges on some older military cadres who are not suitable for grassroots People's Armed forces work, and promote and use some comrades of good comprehensive quality and strong work ability.
Not long ago, a domestic gap was filled by the underwater boat-welding technology invented and developed by the People's Militia technology platoon under the leadership of the secretary of the armed department of the New Century Shipbuilding Company Limited, Chen Yisong, who was exceptionally promoted as the company's armed department leader.

"Small, Scattered, Far and Direct" Education Coordination Zones Go into Operation in a Second Artillery Unit Base
Staff Writer, Report by Xue Bingjian and Correspondent Xu Yeqing: The situation in the "small, scattered, far and direct" units where education organization is difficult, resources are meager, and each fends for itself, will become history at a second artillery unit base.
This correspondent learned recently that following a half-year pilot project, this base has handed down "The Method of Fully Implementing 'An Outline for Ideological and Political Education'."  A number of ideological and political education coordination zones covering all the "small, scattered, far and direct" units in the base have officially been brought into operation.
In order to push ahead with the effective implementation of "An Outline for Ideological and Political Education," the base organized resources at the beginning of the year to conduct in-depth investigation and research of the ideological and political education situation in "small, scattered, far and direct" units.  They combed through important issues that influence and restrict the education time, personnel and results, and initially established this new-style education model of coordination zones for the "small, scattered, far and direct" units.
The concrete approach of coordination zones is to break down the organizational boundaries among units and set up a brigade and regiment-level unit to take the lead in the areas where the "small, scattered, far and direct" units are relatively concentrated, and conduct an integrated program for thematic education, with units falling under different hierarchies coming together in nearby places for lectures or using the help of video link-up systems for remote discussions.
They have adopted a method that integrates taking turns in giving lessons and competing for posts, and unifying the allocation of educational resources.  In each area the use of educational hardware will be integrated, and each unit's materials, data and educational experiences will be shared and exchanged with those of others, with regular organization in each area of typical tour reports and exchanges of what they got from the study by the officers and men.
Every coordination zone has set up a devoted educational liaison person and a part-time educational information gatherer.
On this basis, each coordination zone has also set up systems for seeking assistance on difficult issues, holding joint discussions on major educational themes, reporting critical ideological situations, and assessing tests and evaluations.
Zhang Shengmin, the director of the base's political department, told this correspondent that constructing political education coordination zones has both reduced the waste of educational resources and deepened the impact of education.
Some political instructors fear they will lose marks in front of officers and men from other units and have taken the initiative to study new things and seek new educational methods.
The officers and men receiving the education have also enthusiastically digested the educational content, out of concern over expressing themselves in layman's language in front of the officers and men of friendly neighboring units during discussion and analysis.
In this way, the enthusiasm of the people giving and receiving education has been both effectively stimulated.
A North China Sea Fleet Repair Brigade Fully Allocates its R&amp;R Quota to Sailors
Staff Writer, Report by Zhang Junhong and Liu Hongjun: On July 17, led by vice-chief engineer Zhang Weiliang of a North China Sea fleet repair brigade, 31 of the brigade's long-serving frontline repair sailors happily stepped on a train to go to Beidaihe for a period of rest and recuperation.
Luo Xiangming, an NCO class, happily told this writer, "That the brigade's leaders care about and cherish the sailors deeply moves us.  After a period of rest and recuperation, we will definitely work doubly hard!"
This is actually the first time that this brigade has organized rest and recuperation for grassroots sailors.
Not long ago, the brigade commander Yao Qingsheng went down to the grassroots units and saw that sailors responsible for repair work were braving high temperatures to carry out equipment maintenance and repair work, deeply moving Yao Qingsheng.
"As the sailors work selflessly, the party committee should care about and cherish the sailors, and take responsibility for the sailors' health."  At a meeting of the party committee, Yao Qingsheng's words were endorsed by everyone.
After looking into the matter, the party committee reached a decision to give the entire R&amp;R quota allocated to the brigade by senior authorities to the sailors doing repair work on the frontline.
Doing Things Openly in a Ji'nan Military Command Unit Takes Heat off "Hot-Button Issues"
Staff Writer
Report by Wang Weiqin and Specially Contracted Correspondent Li Deying: On July 25, this writer observed in a service support company of the Ji'nan Military Command that invitations for an army engineering tender, details of financial expenditure, promotions of cadres, non-commissioned officers being admitted to the Party and other major matters were written up on a bulletin board, and hung up conspicuously in a display cabinet.
As Political Commissar Su Chengsen explained, this is a concrete measure adopted by the section to promote a system where things are done openly.
At the beginning of this year, the unit party committee drew up measures including "Two-way Supervision Between the Organization and the Grassroots" and "Publicizing Sensitive Issues" to strengthen the construction of the party spirit and honest government, requiring that for all significant issues that involve the direct interests of the officers and men and army development, the opinions of grassroots officers and men are first heard before decisions are reached, and that standards, procedures, and results etc of the handling of the matters are made public from start to finish in line with the circumstances.
The unit has installed a suggestion box and a bulletin board, and has opened a "message board" on its Intranet to collect everyone's views and recommendations in an extensive way.
At the beginning of the year, as the renovation project of the soldiers' barracks was about to start, before the work began, the party committee organ extensively solicited the views of the officers and men, and then released the information on inviting bids, implementing a system of open tenders.
This both saved money and won the support of the officers and men.
Doing things in an open and fair way has driven the formation of a good atmosphere at the grassroots.
In this unit, the grassroots company insists on making regular public announcements and notices, no matter whether they are issues as big as the determination of "hot-button" sensitive matters, or as trivial as personal vacations to visit relatives or daily income and expenditure in the mess accounts, thus taking the initiative to receive the supervision of the masses.
The Resignation of 13 Pilots Leads China Eastern Airlines Wuhan Company to a Countersuit for Compensation of More than 100000000 Yuan
Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan,  July 11 (Correspondents Liu Yang and Pi Shuchu)
When 13 pilots  handed in their resignations, their "boss," the China Eastern Airlines Wuhan Co. Ltd asked them for compensation for a huge sum of up to 105000000.  This is the largest sum claimed in damages so far in a labor dispute case in Hubei province.
The Labor Dispute Arbitration Commission of Hubei province is currently trying this case.
In May this year, 13 pilots with China Eastern Airlines Wuhan Company in succession handed in their resignations, which were rejected by the company.
Soon afterwards, the pilots applied one after another at the beginning of June to the Labor Dispute Arbitration Commission of Hubei province for labor arbitration, requesting for a ruling that their labor relationship with China Eastern Airlines Wuhan Company be terminated.
After China Eastern Airlines Wuhan Company received notice of the suit, it advanced a counterclaim and requested that the 13 pilots pay for losses caused by their breaking their labor contract agreements and canceling their labor contracts, ranging from more than 6000000 yuan to 10000000 yuan respectively, totaling 105000000 yuan.
It has been learned that the labor contract the pilots signed with China Eastern Airlines was of unfixed duration.  Unless the conditions agreed in the labor contract for breaking off or canceling the agreement applied, the labor contract was to remain in force until the pilots' legal retirement age.
The Labor Dispute Arbitration Commission of Hubei province will try and deal with this case as a suit and a countersuit together, and it is hoped that the hearing will be over by August 8.
(International) North and South Korea to Hold Sixth Colonel-Level Military Talks
Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang,  July 16  (Correspondents Gao Haorong and Xia Yu)
Representatives of the militaries of North Korea and South Korea held military talks and routine contacts in Panmunjom on the 16th, and the two sides agreed after discussion that they will hold their sixth colonel-level military talks from the 24th to the 26th.
According to a report by the Korean Central News Agency, North Korea's military representative and senior colonel in the Korean People's Army, Pak Rim Su, brought forward a proposal during that day's contact to set up a joint fishing zone in North Korea's West Sea between Yonphyong island to Paekryong island, and gave a detailed explanation of the rationale for it.
He said that in order to set up a joint fishing zone, it is necessary to implement the principles such as those of seeking maximum common national prosperity and benefits and of safeguarding peaceful and secure fishing operations.
While talking about the issue of the bilaterally disputed maritime border, Pak Rim Su said that in order to prevent military conflict between the two sides in the West Sea, the two sides should renounce the maritime borders they have hitherto insisted on, recognize and respect each other's rights to territorial seas, and accept as the basis for negotiations the relevant agreements between North Korea and South Korea, the Korean armistice agreement, and internationally recognized law.
He said that the "persistent standpoint" of the North Korean military was to promptly draw up military safeguard measures in order to promote cooperative exchanges between North and South Korea.
He said that the South Korean side should adopt military measures right now to ensure that North Korean civilian vessels can sail directly south from Haeju port and freely pass through the Jeju Straits.
This has been the second round of military talks and routine contacts held recently between both North and South Korea since the 10th of this month.
The fifth colonel-level military talks between North and South Korea was held on May 8-11 in Panmunjom in a "unity pavilion" on the North Korean side.
(Sports) Cuba Complains a Boxing Ring's Rope is Too Short
Xinhua News Agency, Rio de Janeiro, July 21 (Correspondents Chen Weihua and Leng Tong)
The Cuban delegation complained on the 21st that the rope around the boxing ring at this Pan-American Games is too short and will affect the boxers' performance.
According to the regulations of the International Boxing Union, during international matches the rope around the boxing ring should be 6.1 meters, but according to measurements by the Cuban delegation's boxing team coach, Pedro Roque, the length of the rope around the boxing ring at this Pan-American Games is over 1 meter shorter than the norm.
Roque said, "We have submitted a formal protest, because this matter does not affect just one country, Cuba, but involves everyone.
An excessively short rope will affect the boxers' dodging movements."
He also joked, "If they can't find a rope conforming to Olympic standards in Rio, they can go and look somewhere else.
If we had known earlier, we would have brought one from Cuba."
The Mexican and Colombian delegations also expressed dissatisfaction on that day with the length of the rope around the boxing ring.
Although the Colombian boxer, Julio Deibis, won the first match, he said, "Although I have won the first game, the boxing ring is too narrow, and in fact made me feel uncomfortable."
White House Pushes for Nuclear Inspectors to Be Sent as Soon as Possible to Monitor North Korea's Closure of Its Nuclear Reactors
The White House today called for nuclear inspectors to be sent as soon as possible to monitor North Korea's closure of its nuclear reactors.  The White House made this call after US President Bush had telephone conversations with South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun.
White House National Security Council spokesman Johndroe said that the two leaders today had "discussed new developments concerning the US's cooperation with South Korea on the North Korea nuclear issue, and looked forward to the speedy return of IAEA inspectors to North Korea to monitor the shutdown and sealing of the North Korean nuclear reactors."
Johndroe said that the two presidents also welcomed the US-South Korea free trade agreement that was signed +yesterday, and would work to ensure that the congresses of both countries approve this agreement.
Experts believe that the elemental plutonium that Pyongyang has produced over the last 20 years is sufficient to create twelve nuclear weapons.
Hill, the US envoy to the six-party talks, said after a visit to Pyongyang last week that he expected the Yongbyon nuclear reactors would be shut down in the middle of July.
Torrential Rains Hit Western India, 43 People Dead
Western India was battered by strong winds and torrential rains over the weekend.  Some areas saw serious flooding, and all domestic and overseas flights to and from Mumbai, the major city in the west, were stopped.
Relief officials said today that in total it had caused the deaths of 43 people.
From June to September every year, strong winds and heavy rains brought by the monsoon often cause widespread flood disasters and even human casualties in India, a country with a population of 1100000000.
In this disaster caused by torrential rains, half of the victims were carried away and drowned in the floods; the others died because their houses collapsed or from electrocution caused by short circuits.
Mumbai, India's financial center, was also affected.
Over just two days on the 29th and 30th, rainfall in Mumbai reached 243 mm.
Mumbai's chief administrator, Pathak, said that in this city alone, 13 people had died.
City officials appealed for the 15000000 residents to avoid going out before the torrential rains eased so as to protect their own safety.
Yesterday the rain cleared for a while, but most districts of Mumbai were still completely flooded today.
Satellite Images Show Iran Digging a Tunnel, Feared to be for Protecting Nuclear Facilities
The Institute for Science and International Security, a US think tank, today reported that commercial satellite images have shown that Iran is digging a tunnel in a mountain near the Natanz uranium enrichment facility, which may be for protecting nuclear facilities in the event of air strikes.
The images were taken by US company DigitalGlobe (DigitalGlobe) on June 11 and have been posted on the ISIS website.
The Insitute, located in Washington DC, is a non-profit research organization.
The images show that road building is going on through the mountains just 2.4 kilometers south of the Natanz facility, and within that facility is a uranium enrichment plant.
Analysts Albright and Brannan say in a report that the entrance and exit of the tunnel in the images are not clear, but that "one of the roads seems to lead into a tunnel facility.  The other road may also lead to a tunnel entrance/exit."
They say: "A tunnel facility inside a mountain like this would be of great use in terms of protection during an air strike."
WTO Delegates Propose New Plan, Hoping to Break Deadlock in the Doha Round of Talks
The main delegates at the World Trade Organization talks today suggested that the US make major cuts in its agricultural subsidies and that developing countries significantly reduce import duties on industrial products in order to break the deadlock in the Doha round of trade talks.
Officials say the new "draft models" require the US to reduce its annual subsidies for agriculture from the US $ 19000000000 permitted at present to US $ 16200000000, and developing countries to adjust and reduce import duties on industrial products to below 23%.
These suggestions are aimed at breaking the deadlock in which the Doha round of talks has been stuck for nearly six years, and at bringing the 150 members of the WTO to a compromise agreement.
Director-general Lamy of the WTO called these suggestions "a fair and reasonable foundation for reaching an agreement which has major long-term targets and balance and is development-oriented."
Lamy said: "The member states will not be completely satisfied with the details of the suggestions, but at present the problems causing differences are fewer than  the problems of reaching agreement."
He called for intensive talks to be held over the next few weeks.
Hostage Crisis Countdown: South Korea Talks Directly with Taliban
The Taliban in Afghanistan have kidnapped 23 South Korean hostages and fixed sunset today as the deadline, demanding that South Korea withdraw its troops from Afghanistan or they would kill the hostages.
As the minutes and seconds go by, there have been positive developments in the situation.  South Korean officials held talks with the Taliban for the first time today.
But at the same time the Taliban said that another German hostage who had been kidnapped was in extremely poor health, and had started to become comatose and to lose consciousness.
The Taliban called on Germany and South Korea to withdraw their troops from Afghanistan and demanded 33 guerrillas imprisoned by the Afghan government in exchange for these hostages.
Taliban spokesperson Ahmadi said in a telephone interview by AFP at an undisclosed location: "We have established direct contact with the South Korean delegation through tribal elders."
Amadi said: "We hope this meeting will bring results."
The Taliban set dusk, local time (10:30 p.m. Taiwan time), as the deadline, and will start killing the South Korean hostages as soon as that time passes.
The guerrilla group has already extended the deadline twice.
Difficulty in Reaching Agreement in Dispute over Territorial Waters, Military Meeting Between the Two Koreas Breaks up in Discord
A three-day high-level military meeting between North and South Korea broke up in discord today, because both sides were immovable on the drawing of maritime borders.
The talks, held in the border city of Panmunjom, entered the final day of negotiation today.  North Korea's chief representative Lieutenant-General Kim Yong-Chol (transliterated) said: "We've come to the conclusion that we don't need these fruitless talks any more."
Red-faced and with an obviously displeased expression, Kim Yong-Chol criticized South Korea for intentionally avoiding discussions on drawing a new maritime border to replace the original "Northern Limit Line."
He alleged that the "Northern Limit Line" was not legal.
The "Northern Limit Line," located in the Yellow Sea, was set by the American military in 1953 after the end of the Korean war.  However, in recent years it has become a focus of dispute between the two Koreas, and North Korea has further refused to recognize it.
North Korea says that South Korean warships have illegally invaded these waters, causing tension.  South Korea calls this accusation groundless.
Conflict broke out in local waters in June, 1999, causing the deaths of dozens of North Korean sailors.
In June 2002 there was again news of a similar conflict.  Six South Koreans were unfortunately killed.
US Treasury Secretary Arrives on Visit to China; Environmental Protection and Exchange Rates are Focuses of Concern
US Treasury Secretary Paulson arrived yesterday on a visit to China.  The US is currently doing all it can to persuade China to carry out further necessary economic reforms and work on environmental protection.  The renminbi exchange rate is an issue that will receive particular attention.
US diplomats say that Paulson first visited Xining, capital city of China's large northwestern province of Qinghai.
China is currently carrying out a series of plans for environmental protection near the largest freshwater lake in Qinghai Province.
Today Paulson will move on to Beijing to discuss pushing for progress in the US-China Strategic Economic Dialogue started last year and other issues with Chinese chief officials.
The US-China Strategic Economic Dialogue mainly discusses economic, environmental protection and other issues.  Yet, the most important is the issue of the renminbi exchange rate.  US congressmen believe that the renminbi is excessively undervalued.
The trade deficit between the US and China is quickly escalating.  Internal pressure within the US is gradually rising, and congressmen are ready to take retributive action to resist what they call China's unfair trade policies.
Last week the US Senate Finance Committee overwhelmingly approved a bill requiring the Treasury to identify a list of countries with "fundamentally misaligned" currency exchange rates.  This opens the door for potential economic sanctions to be brought against Beijing.
US congressmen say that the renminbi is undervalued, which makes the price of goods that China sells to the US extremely cheap, and adds to the trade imbalance between the US and China.  Last year the US's trade deficit with China reached US $ 232500000000.
Mourinho Insists He Will Stay at Chelsea and Completely Retire from Soccer Before 60
Ever since the beginning of the season, Mourinho's future at Chelsea has been a hot topic in the media, but as before the Portuguese has again stressed that he will definitely be remaining in west London this summer.
"Some newspapers have listed 14 candidates to be the new manager of Chelsea, but I will stay at Chelsea," Mourinho joked.
Mourinho reiterated that he hoped one day to take up the reins of the Portugal team.  "I really want very much to train the national team, and I believe that one day the Portuguese Football Association will also hope very much to employ me to be the head coach of the national team."
However, the 44 year-old Mourinho does not intend to devote his entire life to soccer.  He said that he would retire before he was 60.  He doesn't want to work into his old age like Bobby Robson or Sir Ferguson.
"I have promised my wife that I won't keep coaching until I'm 70 like Robson and Ferguson."
Mourinho said frankly, "When I'm 60, I want to say farewell to soccer completely.
I have too many things waiting for me to do that I can't do at the moment."
"I don't want to become a soccer consultant or a technical supervisor, like Valdano or Sacchi.
I don't want to play this role.
I don't want to be a club chairman.  I just want to say farewell to soccer completely," Mourinho stressed.

F1 "Spy Case" Hearing Finished Yesterday; McLaren Escapes Penalties for Now
Last night Beijing time, the special hearing held by the FIA World Motor Sports Council in Paris over the Ferrari engineer spy case came to a close.  McLaren, who had been summoned, managed a lucky escape: the council decided not to impose any penalty on McLaren for the time being.
The FIA official website published a statement after the hearing, saying: "Vodafone McLaren Mercedes was in possession of confidential Ferrari information, but at present there is insufficient evidence to show that this information was used improperly in the FIA Formula One World Championship.  Therefore no penalty will be imposed."
However, this does not definitively close the Ferrari engineer spy case.
The Motor Sports Council also said in this decision: "If it is found in the future that the information relating to Ferrari has been used to the detriment of the championship, we reserve the right to request McLaren to return to WMSC for a hearing.  At that time, they may face the penalty of the cancellation of their qualification to take part in the 2007 championship and even the 2008 championship."
Mike Coughlan, the former chief designer for McLaren who has now been suspended from his job, has been found to have been in possession of nearly 800 pages of Ferrari's technical documents.  The contents included sets of details of the design, power, construction, checks, tests, development and operation of Ferrari's 2007 race car.
McLaren insists that no-one else in the team knew about this information before Coughlan was suspended from his job, and that the McLaren car for this season has no elements from Ferrari.

Experts Think Insurance QDIIs Will Not Divert Funds away from Domestic Stock Market in the Short Term
Chinanews.com, July 30
According to a report in China Securities Journal, the Provisional Measure for the Overseas Investment with Insurance Funds was recently published, and insurance funding has greater room for operation in the capital markets.
China Life Insurance Company's chief investment officer Liu Lefei thinks that with the renminbi appreciation and the domestic capital markets improving, insurance institutions will not make large investments overseas through foreign currency purchases in the short term.  This also means that insurance QDIIs will not divert funds away from the domestic stock market in the short term.
The report says that quite a few insurance institutions hold the same view.
Experts say that because there is currently no renminbi derivatives market as yet, and the risk-avoidance techniques of insurance institutions are not sufficient, the time is not yet ripe for large-scale foreign currency purchases.
Liu Lefei says that in the long term, in terms of asset allocation, overseas investment should occupy a certain proportion of an insurance company's overall allocation.
However, given the fairly large upwards pressure on the renminbi at present, China Life would mainly be using its own funds in foreign currencies for making overseas investment.
In the current situation it should take a cautious attitude toward purchasing foreign currencies to invest overseas.

Bian Implies Criticism of Judiciary Getting Involved in Elections; Taiwan's "Judicial Yuan" Denies It and Demands His Explaination
Chinanews.com, July 31  On the 30th Chen Shui-bian questioned that members of the judiciary on the island may have tried to get involved in elections for leaders in the Taiwan region.
Kao Chin-chih, director-general of Taiwan's "Department of Judicial Administration," said on the same day that the current behavior of judges on the island was not as Chen Shui-bian said, and demanded that Chen Shui-bian give an explanation of his comments.
According to reports in Taiwan's United Daily, Chen Shui-bian questioned on the 30th that for political reasons or electoral considerations, judges, prosecutors or investigators may be interfering with, affecting or even trying to control the campaign activities of candidates from all parties.  He said he hoped that this kind of phenomenon did not exist in Taiwan, but that it was perhaps extremely difficult.
Weng Yueh-sheng, "president of the Judicial Yuan" in Taiwan, kept quiet and made no response to Chen Shui-bian's questions, but "Secretary-General" Fan Kuang-chun sent Kao Chin-chih to make a statement on behalf of the "Judicial Yuan."
Kao Chin-chih said that Taiwan's basic law and the "regulations for judges" both explicitly state that judges should be above party factions, must not take part in political party activities, and must not campaign, either.  Judges were all extremely prudent and respected these relevant restrictions, and the "Judicial Yuan" believed that judges all acquit themselves admirably.
Kao Chin-chih gave an example, saying that "High Court Kaohsiung Branch Court" judge Chang Sheng-hsi took part in a class at the Ketagalan Institute a few years ago, the self-regulation council organized by judges decided to punish him because the relevant syllabus had political party implications.
Once Chang Sheng-hsi wanted to take part in the DPP primaries, but because of controversy over retaining his position and taking part in the election, he decided in the end to give up on it.
Kao Chin-chih believes that if it's specific judgments in cases, there is relief available at the court level, and one should not infer that judges have political intentions simply based on wins or losses in the verdicts.
Don't Blindly Worship Legal "Theory Circle"
It is stipulated in Article 8 of the draft amendment of the Lawyers Law which has been recently submitted to the NPC standing committee for review that people who were once engaged in the profession of researching and teaching laws and have obtained advanced professional titles or equivalent professional levels may be granted the permission to practice law when their applications for lawyers' licenses pass the review by the judicial administrative department of the State Council.
(June 28, the China Youth Daily)
In the legal community there is a distinction between the "theory circle" and the "practice circle."  The former mainly includes the "abstract activities" such as teaching and researching laws, while the latter is more engaged in the "concrete activities" such as litigation, legal counseling, and legal services.
For a long time there has existed a phenomenon of "scholars' mutual contempt" between the legal "theory circle" and the "practice circle."  The "theory circle" believes that the "practice circle" lacks the necessary legal training and consists only of mechanical "legalists," while the "practice circle" criticizes the "theory circle" by pointing out that "theory cannot direct practice."
With regard to such a labor division, what the law can do is to maintain neutrality rather than vigorously support either party.
However, the "system of specially licensed lawyers" in the Lawyers Law acknowledges in reality the judgment that the legal "theory circle" is superior to the legal "practice circle."
In fact, some experts and scholars who have been engaged in the research and teaching of pure legal theories such as the history of the legal system and the international laws have nothing to do with practicing law no matter how profound their theoretical achievements have been.
Thus, the "system of specially licensed lawyers" has doubtlessly opened up a "bad loophole" for confusing qualification in the legal "practice circle" which will have an extremely negative impact.
There is also more blind worship of the "theory circle" than these.  For example, the phenomenon that expert opinions and expert panels frequently influence and even negate court rulings is also a direct manifestation of such blind worship.
Chinese-owned Vessels Encouraged to Sail under Five-Star Red Flag
Staff Writer, Correspondent Feng Lei
It was learned at the press conference held by the State Council Information Office that starting from July 1 this year, China will implement the Ad hoc Tax-free Registration Policy for Chinese-owned International Shipping Vessels to encourage Chinese-owned vessels flying foreign flags to register back in the country so as to acquire the nationality of the People's Republic of China and sail under the five-star red flag.
In order to further promote the healthy growth of the maritime shipping industry in our country and expand the national fleet and address the relevant problems arising from a considerable number of our country's vessels engaged in international shipping registering overseas and operating under foreign flags, the Ministry of Communications has recently issued "The Public Notice Regarding the Implementation of the Ad hoc Tax-free Registration Policy for Chinese-owned International Shipping Vessels," clarifying the conditions for enjoying the ad hoc tax-free policy and the application procedures.  Starting from July 1 this year, eligible vessels which submit import declarations within two years shall be exempt from customs duties and import VAT.
Applicant vessels may choose Shanghai, Tianjin, or Dalian as their ports of nationality to process vessel registration.
Britain Lowers Terrorist Attack Alert Level
Staff Writer, London, July 5 (Correspondent Guo Lin)
On the 4th, the British government lowered the terrorist attack alert level from the highest level to the "severe" level.  This shows that terrorist attacks in Britain will not be imminent, but attacks are still "highly likely."
At present, the British police has shifted its scope of investigation to India and Australia.
Since the eight terrorist attack suspects that have been arrested had all worked in the medical system, the government will conduct an emergency investigation of the backgrounds of foreign immigrants who have been employed in the medical system.
It was learned that nearly 90000 people employed in the British public medical system have all obtained their qualification for practicing medicine from abroad.
In addition Prime Minister Brown required that background checks be conducted for high-tech immigration applicants and that employers or relevant agencies shall be required to provide applicants' background data.
Keep Public Places from Harassment of Peddlers
When people go out traveling, they are looking for relaxation, freshness, and freedom, enjoying as much as possible the natural scenery and achievements of civilized society.
However, while traveling in the country, many people have experienced such nuisance as being besieged and cornered by peddlers and middlemen in public places.
Whether you are getting on or off a bus or train, you invariably suffer the harassment of peddlers and some unlicensed middlemen.
They either sell chicken eggs, peanuts, or sesame seed cakes, or newspapers and magazines.  In addition, many unlicensed middlemen make referrals to restaurants and lodgings, even hawking fake certificates, fake receipts, and so on.
If you don't take them, he can chase you for several hundreds of meters as if he would rather die than fail.
In some scenic spots, many tourists also have the same experience.
Before you enter the main gate, someone would come to hawk things like tourist souvenirs and small pieces of arts and crafts.
There are more scenarios of this kind after you go through the gate, which completely ruins even your best mood.
Some media once reported that many foreign tourists coming to Xi'an praised endlessly the places of historic interest and scenic beauty in Xi'an, but felt it was incomprehensible that crowds of peddlers are allowed to hawk their wares everywhere.
Such public places including bus stations and scenic spots are places meant for traveling and recreation.  Attention should be paid to civility and orderliness as well as tranquility and harmony, providing tourists a comfortable and relaxing environment.
The unrestricted entry and exit of peddlers not only disturb the mood of tourists, but also actually destroy the public order of these public places, giving rise to the visual contamination and environmental contamination, while providing the conditions and opportunities for lawless people to make trouble.
The important thing is that these public places are the windows of spiritual civilization construction in the local areas.  A small glimpse can reveal a larger picture.  Not only the image is being damaged but the growth of local economy will also be impacted.
Just imagine, if you want to expand and strengthen the tourism industry but welcome guests traveling from all directions with such a messy tourist environment, who will still want to come, and who still dare to come?
Then how can your tourist economy gain returns?
As the tourist high season approaches, creating a civilized tourist environment for tourists coming from all directions should be considered the top priority.
Public places are not markets.  The operation by peddlers should be regulated.  Unlicensed operation must be resolutely banned, and there should be relentless crackdown on illegal activities.
Only a civilized and orderly environment can get tourists to come happily, who will leave after fully enjoying themselves and keep the passion for a return trip.
In a word, keep public places from the harassment of peddlers.
"Rewarding Voluntary Withdrawal from Welfare System" Does Not Hold Water
The Jianguomen Neighborhood in Dongcheng District of Beijing gave away things like refrigerators as rewards to twelve households that voluntarily withdrew from the welfare system.
(The Beijing News, July 10)
While feeling happy for these families for the improvement of their lives, this writer is ambivalent toward the proposal of "voluntary withdrawal from the welfare system" and the "reward-giving" method.
The deputy director of the Jianguomen Neighborhood office said, "In response to the issue of the welfare fraud, encouraging voluntary withdrawal from the welfare system aims to set a good example for other households on welfare."
If it is to encourage other welfare recipients to get out of their difficult situations through their own efforts, then this example is indeed worth promoting.  If this is intended to "appeal" to those longtime cheaters of the welfare system, then it may be a bit naive.
Working to distinguish between real and fake welfare recipients and sort them out, we should rely more on the law.
The relevant department should stress the obligations that welfare recipients must carry out while enjoying the welfare: for example, promptly notifying the changes in the family members and incomes, reporting the status of employment, accepting regular reviews, etc.  On the other hand, the relevant department should step up monitoring and inspection.
After all, only "withdrawing from the welfare system according to the law" is the long-term strategy.
Who will foot the bill for the material rewards given by the neighborhood to the households that withdrew from the welfare system?
As a level-one government organization, the neighborhood's expenses are covered by the funding from the government budget.
However, is it legitimate to spend this sum of tax payers' money?
On the one hand, households that have withdrawn from the welfare system prove that they have attained certain abilities to be "self-sufficient;" on the other hand, aren't there still people who apply for the welfare?
The funding from the government budget which is called "life-saving" money should be used to provide timely help instead of extra bonus.
Liu Gangyi's Remark about His Willingness to Be a Service Provider Is More Believable
On July 10, Liu Gangyi, the party committee secretary of Mulan Township, Xindu District, Chengdu City, who is the first township party committee secretary through public nomination and direct election in the whole country, received his fourth democratic evaluation since he took office.  The rate of satisfaction reached 97%.
During his conversation with reporters, Liu Gangyi defined himself as a "service provider."
(Yesterday, The Beijing News)
The "service provider" as spoken by Liu Gangyi is probably more truthful and more believable than the "service provider" as spoken by some appointed cadres.
The greatest advantage of public nomination and direct election as compared with the system of appointment lies in the fact that in the former the source of power is mainly determined by ordinary party members and the masses, while in the latter it is mainly appointed by upper-level organizations.  And where the power originates determines that the former must take its  responsibility to the general public as top priority.
The source of power and to whom they should answer are the basic factors that determine how the elected will go about their work.
Some people suspect that this kind of "democratic evaluation" is more like a "democracy show."
My opinion is that it is better to have this form of "democratic evaluation" than nothing at all.
Considering the history and current status of China's grassroots democratic and political construction, I think that it is already a major breakthrough to have public nomination and direction election.  Being a major component of this innovation, the democratic evaluation is not to be underestimated in promoting the grassroots democratic and political construction.
First Woman President Expected to Be Elected in India; Analysts Call Her Election Quite Likely; Female Voters Hope She Can Raise the Status of Women
On June 23, Patil brought her hands together palm to palm before she filled the presidential candidate documents.
India's presidential election kicked off on the 19th.  The new president will be chosen between the current vice president Shekhawat and Pratibha Patil, who recently resigned as governor of Rajasthan.
Patil is the first woman presidential candidate in the history of India.  If she is elected, she will become the first woman president ever in the Indian history.
Patil is the presidential candidate for the ruling party INC, while Shekhawat is from the opposition party BJP.
Since the INC occupies a dominant position in the presidential electoral college, the media and the general public all speculate that Patil is rather likely to be elected.
Patil, currently 72 years old, was a woman governor of Rajasthan.
She was born into a lawyer's family and entered the parliament in 1985.  With rich experiences in politics, she was well acclaimed by the government during her tenure as governor of Rajasthan.
In addition she is devoted to the social welfare and is the honorary chairperson of many cultural, educational, and social welfare organizations.
Analysts pointed out that the reason why Patil became a candidate is because she has remained loyal to the INC president Sonia Gandhi.
In India the Gandhi family has controlled the ruling INC party for a long time.
Patil is supported and respected by a large number of female voters.  Female voters believe that Patil will reshape the image of women and raise the status of women in India, where discrimination against females is a dominant ideology.
The constitution stipulates that India is a federal-system country .  The president is the nominal head of state and commander of the armed forces, representing no party organization and serving more as a symbol.

Two Jordanese Sentenced for Plotting an Attack on Americans
Two Jordanese men were sentenced by the Jordanian State Security Court on the 11th for plotting to attack Americans in Jordan.
Of the two men, both aged 25, one called Sameeh al-Hotari was sentenced to 8 years' imprisonment with forced labor, and the other called Mohammed Shehada was sentenced to three years' imprisonment with forced labor.
A court official said that al-Hotari was also charged with illegal possession of firearms, and that the police had found an assault rifle while searching his place of residence.
The court originally decided to sentence al-Hotari to life imprisonment, but later considered giving him an opportunity to "turn over a new leaf," and reduced the sentence to 8 years.
According to the indictment, after the outbreak of the Iraq war the two accused decided to avenge the Muslims who were "being bullied by the Americans," and plotted to attack Americans living in Jordan.
In August 2006 they selected as a target an American living in a suburb of the Jordanian capital, Amman, but were arrested by the police before carrying out an attack on him.
The identity of this American was not made public in the indictment.
The indictment also charged the two defendants with planning to attack other Americans, but no concrete details were divulged.

Security Council Decides to Extend the Term of Peacekeeping Troops in Ethiopia and Eritrea
The UN Security Council passed a unanimous resolution on the 30th, agreeing to extend the term of UN peacekeeping troops based in Ethiopia and Eritrea (UNMEE) by six months until January 31 next year.
The resolution requires all the parties concerned to fulfill their commitments, continue exercising restraint, ease the tense situation and avoid provocative military activities; calling on Eritrea to pull its troops and heavy military equipment out of the Temporary Security Zone immediately and calling on Ethiopia to reduce the number of additional military troops recently deployed in the vicinity of the Temporary Security Zone.

07-Series Military Uniform Designers Visit China Military Online
Staff Writer,  Beijing, July 13  Report by Yang Baojin and Correspondent Liu Xinxin: The whole of the army will change into 07-series military uniforms in succession from August 1.
This evening, China Military Online has specially invited Chen Jun, the deputy director of the Clothing and Equipment Office of the Military Supplies and Fuel Division of the General Logistics Department, and Su Yang, senior engineer in the Military Supplies Equipment Research Office of the General Logistics Department and one of the designers of the 07-series military uniforms, to be its guests at China Military Online, and engage in free discussions with netizens both in and outside the army on the background to the development of the new military uniforms and the manufacturing process, provoking a response from the netizens.
The two honored guests directly took part in the design and manufacture of the 07-series military uniforms.
While discussing the changes in the new uniforms, they explained that the 07-series uniforms were designed on the basis of previous uniform changes, in particular, the 97-series uniforms, and had made improvements in seven areas, including the uniform series, standards, and styles, totaling hundreds of items.
The greatest feature of the 07-series uniforms is that it has reflected the requirements for serialization, functionalization and personalization, allowing our army's military uniform to achieve standards in terms of coordination among the three armed services, completeness of varieties and the way the series forms a set for the first time.  This signifies the realization of a historical leap in the level of our army's military uniform development.
The two honored guests also carried out wide-ranging exchanges with the netizens on issues such as the new uniforms' types, styles, specifications, and accessories.
This interview was jointly sponsored by China Military Online and china.org.cn, sina.com.cn and TOM.com.
When You Start Well, You Still Need to Finish Well
Judging simply from the result of the match, 2-2 seems a reasonable score, and is also one that the Chinese team can accept.  The key problem is that the way the match went made people feel it was rather a pity.
If the Iranian team had taken a 2-0 lead, then the Chinese team had evened up the score, then the feeling that would have given China's sports fans would certainly have been different.  It would have boosted morale.  The pity was that the situation was precisely the opposite.
You could say that starting well but being unable to finish well is an old problem of the Chinese team.
The Chinese team often don't kick the ball when they have an excellent chance, and most people's view is that the psychological quality of China's players is not really up to it.
This is actually one reason why the Chinese team cannot "finish well."
However, judging by the Chinese team's match today, it may not be quite so.
Even if we set aside the fact that Sun Jihai, Sun Xiang, Shao Jiayi, Zheng Zhi and others have played in Europe, Li Weifeng and others are also old-timers with long experience of the battlefield.  They have experience and knowledge, and so it would be reasonable to say that there should not be any problem with their psychological quality.
The reason why the Chinese team was regrettably forced to a draw by the Iranian team this time may be because they deployed their forces in a lackadaisical manner at key points of the match.
When the Iranian team were behind, they substituted two persons, and the scene immediately seemed different.
In the second half, the Chinese team also substituted three players, but without a positive effect.
To overcome the problem of starting well but being unable to finish well, it is definitely necessary to pinpoint the source of the problem.
As long as the problem is correctly grasped, it will probably not be difficult to find a way to get rid of the problem.
The worst thing when you have a serious illness is just to go to see any doctor.
If they carry on like this, no matter how many matches the Chinese team play, the old problem will still continue, and the constant progress with every game that everyone expects will be out of the question.
(International) Research Shows a Link between Arrhythmia and Two Forms of Genetic Variation
Xinhua News Agency, London,  July 2  Icelandic scientists have discovered through research that the risk of arrhythmia among people with two types of genetic variation in their bodies is far greater than among ordinary people.
According to a report in the latest issue of Nature magazine, after researchers at Iceland's deCode Genetics Inc sifted through the genes of thousands of people from Iceland, Sweden, and the US, as well as China's Hong Kong region, they made the above-mentioned discovery.
The two genes discovered by the scientists are located close to a gene that plays an important role in the early growth of the heart.
Arrhythmia, namely atrial fibrillation, is one of the most common clinically observed irregularities of the rhythm of the heart, and can lead to heart palpitations, shortness of breath, tiredness as well as apoplectic fits.
And according to a report in the Nature Genetics magazine that came out on the 1st, researchers at deCode Genetics Inc have also discovered two genes on the 17th chromosome in human beings that is connected to the onset of cancer in the prostate gland.  They play some role in more than one-third of cases of cancer in the prostate gland.
The research also discovered that one of the genes, while increasing people's risk of suffering from the cancer of the prostate gland, also lowered the risk of suffering from Type 2 diabetes.
(Sports) Veteran US Goalkeeper Keller May Retire after America's Cup
Xinhua News Agency, Maracaibo (Venezuela) July 3 (Correspondent Liu Jian)
According to a report in the Venezuelan media on the 3rd, the US team's 37-year-old veteran goalkeeper, Keller, said during an interview here that if he could not find a suitable club to serve in after the America's Cup, then he would opt to retire.
"If I have not been able to get a contract for 1-2 seasons with a high-quality league team within four to six weeks of the conclusion of the America's Cup, then maybe retiring will not be a bad choice for me."
With the relegation of the Möchengladbach team to the 2nd Bundesliga, Keller also left this soccer team in which he had served for more than two seasons.
Although Keller has a mind to retire, he has many opportunities and clearly need not worry about finding a place.  He himself has frankly stated that there are currently as many as eight soccer teams that are interested in inviting him to join them.
However, this veteran goalkeeper who has served in league matches for the Spanish Primera Liga, the English Premiership, and the German Bundesliga, said that what he ultimately chooses to do will be decided by his family.  "My kid is already 9 years old.  He has followed me around and stayed in three different countries, and has been to three different schools, and so I need to consider in my current choice what would be better for my family."
In the Gold Cup competition that was concluded not long ago, Keller put in an outstanding performance, helping the US team to win the title.
In the current America's cup, he has, just as before, been given an important job to do by head coach Bradley, but he clearly cannot win the match singlehanded.  The US team, made up of "young guards," is no match for such strong South American opponents as Argentina and Paraguay, and during these two matches the goal he guarded was breached seven times.
The next match against Colombia will probably be the US team's and Keller's last performance in this America's Cup competition.

Balsillie said that the launch on the market last week of Apple Inc's iPhone had made people more and more aware of intelligent cellphones, and that Blackberry cellphones are currently being sold in more than 100 countries around the globe as a competitor of iPhone.
According to statistics, in the first quarter of this year, new users of RIM's Blackberry cellphones reached 1200000, with the overall number of users reaching 9200000.
(International) Spain: Husband who Wore Mask to Kill his Wife Is Arrested
Xinhua News Agency, Madrid, July 7  A Spanish woman was attacked by a masked hoodlum, and during the struggle she pulled off the hoodlum's face covering and was surprised to find that the assaulter was actually her own husband.  The police have arrested him.
According to a report in the media over here on the 6th, the woman works in a bakery in the city of Valencia.
One day, a masked man stormed into the shop, and she thought he was a robber and told him to take some money from the drawer and get out.
But instead of taking any money, the man grabbed the women by the neck and tried to kill her.
She tried to pretend she was dead to escape her fate, but the man still did not let her go and carried on kicking her and choking her by the neck.
In the struggle, the women pulled down the villain's face covering, but found to her surprise that the man was actually her husband.
The assaulter has been arrested by the police.
The female victim told the media that she and her husband are in the middle of divorce procedures because of their failure to get along with each other, and they have two children.
(International) Germany Calls on Russia to Ratify Latvian-Russian Border Treaty as Soon as Possible
Xinhua News Agency, Riga, July 12 (Correspondent Yang Dehong) German Foreign Minister Steinmeier currently visiting Latvia called on Russia on the 12th to ratify the Latvian-Russian border treaty as soon as possible.
On that day Steinmeier held talks with Latvian Foreign Minister Pabriks.  The two sides mainly discussed issues such as Latvian-German relations and Latvian cooperation with the EU, and exchanged opinions and views on the development of Latvian-Russian relations and EU-Russian relations.
In the press conference held after the talks, Steinmeier called on Russia to ratify the Latvian-Russian border treaty as soon as possible.
Steinmeier said that steps towards an improvement in relations between Latvia and all the countries in the Baltic Sea region and Russia have been relatively slow, and that the process of signing the Latvian-Russian border treaty bears witness to a process of development in Latvian-Russian relations, but "the shadow of history" may also cause Latvian-Russian relations to go backwards once again.  He hoped that Russia can ratify the Latvian-Russian border treaty as soon as possible, in order to promote forward development in the two countries' relationship.
On March 27 this year, after talks lasting 10 years, Latvian Prime Minister Kalvitis and Russian Prime Minister Fradkov signed a bilateral border treaty in Moscow.
On May 17 the Latvian parliament ratified the Latvian-Russian border treaty.
According to a report in the Latvian media, the Russian parliament will hold a vote on the treaty in the near future.
(International) Hyundai Motor Denies Its Intention to Buy Volvo
Xinhua News Agency, Seoul, July 18  A spokesperson for the South Korean Hyundai Motor Company said in Seoul on the 18th that the company had no intention of buying Volvo or any brand controlled by the Ford Motor Company.
The Sunday Times and the New York Times both recently reported the news that Ford may sell off Volvo.
The Sunday Times further said in its report that the South Korean Hyundai Motor Company is a potential buyer of Volvo.
A spokesperson for Hyundai Motor Company said, "We don't have any interest in buying Volvo, Jaguar or Rover," and "at this moment Hyundai is busy implementing its own expansion plan, and basically has no time for other things."
In 1999 Ford spent US $ 6450000000 buying the Volvo brand from the Swedish Volvo Group.
At present, Volvo together with Rover and Jaguar etc fall under Ford's Premier Automotive Group (PAG).
In March this year, Ford, which has fallen into financial deficit, sold the PAG-affiliated Aston Martin for US $ 848000000.  Last month, it also said it is considering selling Rover and Jaguar.
Exports of White Rabbit Candy Resumed as Overseas Distributors Increase Their Orders
Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 24  (Correspondents Xu Shousong and Yu Lihong) The correspondents learned from Guan Sheng Yuan (Group) Co. Ltd that exports of White Rabbit candy held up for a time at the Shanghai port have recently been resumed, and a considerable number of overseas agents have one after another increased their orders.
Mr. Lim Cheng Eng of the Hock Lam company, Guan Sheng Yuan's distributor in Singapore, recently called the Guan Sheng Yuan Group to say that since the result of a sample examination of White Rabbit candy by Singapore's Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority showed that they did not contain formaldehyde and could be sold on the market normally, he wanted to place additional orders.
Guan Sheng Yuan's Malaysian distributor, the Feng Sheng company, said that it had asked Guan Sheng Yuan to immediately dispatch a container of the White Rabbit candy to Malaysia from Shanghai.
Guan Sheng Yuan's distributor in Hong Kong, Ng Fung Trading Co. Ltd, also phoned Guan Sheng Yuan to say that Hong Kong's Center for Food Safety had taken random samples of White Rabbit candy from a Hong Kong supermarket and chemicals tests had confirmed that they do not contain formaldehyde.
Ng Fung Trading Co. Ltd has received notification from Hong Kong's China Resources Supermarket of its decision to resume sales of White Rabbit candy in its more than 100 stores in Hong Kong.
It is learned that 10 containers of White Rabbit candy that had been held up for a time at the Shanghai port have gradually resumed exportation.
At present, 7 containers of White Rabbit candy are being dispatched to countries including Singapore, Costa Rica, Malaysia, India, Nepal, and the US.
(International) Man Suspected of Making Bomb Threats to a British Supermarket Is Arrested
Xinhua News Agency, London, July 26  The British police announced on the 26th that a man suspected of making bomb threats to the British supermarket Tesco in mid-July was arrested on the 23rd in Clitheroe, Lancashire.
The police said that this man, named Philip McHugh, is 51 years old and unemployed.  He will be charged with blackmail and creating bomb scare.
On the afternoon of July 14 ( Saturday), 14 branches nationwide of the supermarket Tesco in Britain were shut by the police as an emergency as a result of bomb threats, and were only able to resume their business on the following day.
Saturday is the peak time for British people to go to the supermarket and do their shopping, and the closure of 14 supermarkets at that time caused Britain's largest supermarket chain to lose millions of pounds of sales revenue.
The British police carried out a criminal investigation into this bomb threat case soon afterwards and announced that they did not find any traces of terrorist activity in this case, but there were probably some economic motives behind it.
(International) Turkey's Ruling Party Wins Parliamentary Election
Xinhua News Agency, Ankara, July 30 (Correspondent Wang Jian) The final results of the 23rd round of parliamentary election announced by Turkey's Supreme Election Commission on the 30th show that the ruling Justice and Development Party won 341 of the 550 parliamentary seats, once again winning the right to form a single-party government.
In the parliamentary election held on July 22, the main opposition Republican People's Party won 112 parliamentary seats.
The Nationalist Action Party won 71 parliamentary seats in the election.
Apart from the above-mentioned political parties, 26 independents were also elected as members of parliament.
The new Turkish parliament will hold its first meeting on August 4.
At that time, all of the members of parliament will be sworn in and will begin to carry out their duties.
After this, the parliament will elect a new speaker by means of a secret ballot.
The Turkish parliamentary election was originally scheduled to be held in November, but during the presidential election at the end of April the boycott of the opposition parties against the only candidate -- Deputy PrimeMinister and Foreign Minister Gul, who belongs to the Justice and Development Partyl -- led to the failure of the presidential elections, consequently bringing forward the parliamentary election.
Strong Earthquakes Affect Parts Production; Japanese Auto Plants Cut or Stop Production
This week Japan was hit by strong earthquakes, which caused a shortage of auto parts.  Toyota, Nissan and other auto manufacturers said today that they would cut or even suspend domestic car production.
The day before yesterday Japan was hit by a strong earthquake measuring 6.8 on the Richter scale.  Auto part manufacturer Riken Corporation was forced to suspend operation of a factory in a northwestern district of Tokyo.  This had a knock-on effect on auto production.
A spokeswoman for Toyota, the best-selling auto-maker in the world, said that Toyota would suspend domestic auto production from tonight till the 21st.
Nakagawa, a spokesman for Nissan, said that from the day after tomorrow until the 23rd, two of Nissan's three factories in Japan would suspend part of their production operations, and that they would reassess the situation at the weekend.
He said that both of the two factories had two production lines, of which one production line would be affected, but the company may increase the number of shifts next month to make up for lost production time.
Suzuki Auto said that it would stop some production for three days starting from tomorrow.  Fuji Heavy Industries Corporation, which produces Subaru vehicles, would also suspend manufacturing smaller vehicles starting from tomorrow, and would assess the situation on the 21st.
Meanwhile, Honda Motor said that next week it might pause operations on some of its production lines that rely on the supply of parts.
This earthquake caused the deaths of at least 10 people.  Over 1000 people were injured and hundreds of houses collapsed, further forcing factories in affected areas to stop operations.
Worries over Buying Frenzy, Indonesia Cancels Sale of Environmentally-friendly Bags from Well-known British Brand
A sales agent said today that Indonesia had canceled the sale of environmentally-friendly bags from a well-known British brand in the light of the chaos caused by the buying frenzy earlier this month in Hong Kong.
The manager of On Pedder, a well-known store located in the high-end Plaza Indonesia, said: "In the light of the events in Hong Kong, we have canceled the sale of environmentally-friendly bags.
If the public is going to brawl over a 140000-rupiah (about 494 NTD) bag, then it's not worth that."
Thousands of Hong Kong residents gathered outside the shop selling them on the 6th, ready to scramble for the limited-edition, environmentally-friendly bags, which were designed by British designer Anya Hindmarch and are printed with "I am not a plastic bag."  But the shop staff refused to open the doors, causing the situation to get out of control.
These top-end products, aimed at protecting the environment, are attempting to replace plastic bags, and unexpectedly became a fashion symbol instantly in London and New York.  They have triggered a buying frenzy as the price on auction website eBay has soared to many times the retail price.
On Pedder, the only authorized vendor in Indonesia, said that it was not sure whether or not it would begin the sale in a few days.
"Illegal Brick Kiln" Trial Starts for Wang Bingbing of Caosheng Village, Hongdong, Shanxi (Picture)
Chinanews.com, July 4  The intermediate court of Linfen Municipality in Shanxi Province this morning began the first instance hearing in the "illegal brick kiln" case of Wang Bingbing of Caosheng Village, Guangshengsi Township, Hongdong County, Shanxi, amid great public interest.
Many domestic media outlets are following the progress of this case.
Because the local government departments involved are rather cautious, some reporters were not able to go in and do interviews at the scene.
The court trial is currently still in progress.
The staff at the Linfen intermediate criminal court revealed that if the trial goes smoothly, it could probably finish today.
But it is not yet known whether the judgment in this case will be announced at court.
At about nine o'clock in the morning, some reporters looked at the situation outside the front door of the Linfen intermediate court.  Passers-by were calm, and traffic was normal.
Perhaps they felt accustomed to the trial going on inside the court.
"When the time comes there'll be a verdict.  I believe the law is fair,"
a senior citizen said to himself as he passed by here and raised his head to look for a moment at the national emblem.
Previously, news from Hongdong County had confirmed that Wang Dongji, father of the defendant Wang Bingbing and former Party branch secretary of Caosheng Village, had been legally stripped of his status as a representative at the county People's Congress.
Previously, Wang Dongji had been removed from his position as secretary of the village Party branch with his Party membership revoked because of the issue of suspected breaches of discipline in the Wang Bingbing "illegal brick kiln" case.
The incident of slave labor in illegal brick kilns in Shanxi sparked by the Wang Bingbing illegal brick kiln case has attracted attention both at home and abroad.  High level central officials issued instructions demanding serious investigation.

Germany Plans to Lower Threshold for Bringing in Professionals
Staff Writer, Berlin, July 1 (Correspondent Wang Huaicheng)
German Federal Minister of Education and Research Schavan said recently that Germany should lower the qualifying conditions for bringing in foreign professionals in the Immigration Law and solve the problem of the shortage of professionals that Germany is facing through increasing the recruitment of foreign talents.
According to a report by OECD, by 2010 the number of workers between age 15 and 64 in Germany will be gradually decreasing each year.
If there are not enough immigrants, the labor force in Germany in 2020 will decrease by 6% as compared with the present.
However, reports by organizations such as the German Employers Association and the German Association of Engineers show that there is a relatively large shortage of engineers and professionals in the current job market in Germany.
According to the statistics from Germany's Federal Labor Department, this May, the supply of engineers in the labor market in Germany had a shortfall of about 12700 people and the supply of technicians had a shortfall of about 9600 people.
In order to protect native employment, Germany has set a relatively high threshold for bringing in foreign talents.
Germany's Immigration Law stipulates that professionals from non-EU countries should have annual salaries of no less than € 85500 in Germany, otherwise they cannot get the permit to work and live in Germany.
Schavan suggests that this qualifying amount be reduced to 40000 to € 60000.
Toll of Eternal Warning Bell "Links up" with Hong Kong as the World Jointly Celebrates Ten Years of Reversion
On July 1, the Eternal Warning Bell in the Memorial Hall of Nanjing's Jinghai Temple was tolled once again, the sound of the bell ringing melodiously.
This rich echo of history connected the mainland and Hong Kong via television, as the citizens of Nanjing and Hong Kong compatriots "shared the same occasion from the far corners of the earth" and celebrated together the tenth anniversary of Hong Kong's reversion to the motherland.
Ten years previously, at 12:00 a.m. on July 1, the sound of the tolling of the Eternal Warning Bell reverberated 155 times in the sky over the bell tower of the Memorial Hall of Nanjing's Jinghai Temple, bidding farewell to the humiliating history of the cession of Hong Kong island.
People from all walks of life in Nanjing society gathered together in front of the gate of the smallish Memorial Hall.  They said that they wanted to give an eternal warning to themselves and to later generations not to forget history by ringing this Eternal Warning Bell with their own two hands.
"The bell of the Eternal Warning Bell is 1.842 meters high, and the year 1842 was precisely when the 'Nanjing Treaty' was concluded at the time of the eruption of the Opium War.
The shoulder of the bell is 1.997 meters high, and 1997 was the year of Hong Kong's reversion."
The man behind the devising and casting of the Eternal Warning Bell that year, Wang Fengling, explained that "there are five 'wan' character inscriptions around the body of the bell.  The whole copper bell is in high relief, with two dragons supporting a fireball, symbolizing the fact that Hong Kong is the motherland's 'Pearl of the Orient.'  Finally, Nanjing's city flower, the plum blossom, forms the pattern on the body of the bell where the bell is struck."
Yu Xiaodong, a member of the Democratic Party and the first person back then to propose the construction of the Eternal Warning Bell sighed with emotion, saying, "Before we knew it, it has been ten years already since the reversion of Hong Kong."  He hopes that Hong Kong's tomorrow could be like the sound of that tolling bell, "resounding and melodious, ongoing and everlasting."

Three Main Functions of Modern Military Uniform
The first is the identification function.
It is an important sign that distinguishes the armies of different countries, different military services, and between the military and civilians.
In the armies of more than 100 large and small countries of the world, although the use of military uniform is basically identical, there are no two countries' armies whose military uniforms are completely the same.
The second is the symbolic function.
To a certain extent, military uniform is both a reflection of a country's mental outlook and its national characteristics, and is also a concentrated embodiment of a country's military ability to wage war and the quality of its servicemen.
In the three main types of military uniform -- ceremonial attire, everyday uniforms, and drill uniforms -- the one that can express national prestige and military prestige to the fullest extent is none other than ceremonial attire that is well-pressed and pleasing to the eye.
The third is the protective function.
With the rapid development of high-tech and updated weaponry, improving the overall protective capacity of new-style drill uniforms to give military uniform various types of functions -- including bulletproofing, stealth protection, anti-chemical, anti-bacterial and anti-radiation functions, as well as control of the temperature, humidity and the air -- has become a key issue in the development of military uniform.

A Brigade Party Committee Organ Has the Courage to Handle Thorny Issues Properly
Staff Writer, Chengdu, July 3
Report by Qu Yimao and Yang Ruiyu: "We can now move into apartments as a result of the brigade party committee organ's resolution and boldness in freeing up the apartments."
Today, more than ten cadres in a communications drill brigade in Chengdu Military Command were all beaming with pleasure as they moved into apartments.  They felt full of admiration and gratitude for the way the "group" on the brigade party committee dared to confront tough obstacles in solving thorny issues.
Over the past few years, along with the replacement of personnel, an excessive part of the brigade's accommodation for family members had been occupied against regulations, making it difficult to house the cadres on active duty.  Officers and men had quite strong views about this.
The brigade had tried to free up the apartments several times, but failed to get it done each time due to all kinds of obstruction, allowing the problem to become a long-standing, big and difficult issue.
"As long as we have the courage to do things properly and are fair and reasonable, there are no difficulties we cannot solve."
After the group on the new party committee had reached a consensus, the principal leaders appeared in person and set about thoroughly sorting out all the problems relating to occupation of apartments against regulations.
On the one hand they appealed to people's emotions and explained their reasoning, hoping that the personnel concerned would consider the whole picture; on the other hand, they explained the policies and regulations relating to military apartments, apartments built with pooled money, and economical and adequate apartments, to show the party committee's staunch determination and principled stance.
In the case of personnel who had accommodation elsewhere and were not willing to leave the additional apartments they occupied, the party committee organ promptly made contact with the work units they were in and adopted relevant measures to encourage them to take the initiative in cooperating with the work of the army.
Over two months of meticulous work, all residents occupying additional apartments in the army barracks against regulations had all moved out on schedule, and cadres who worked in the brigade were all assigned the accommodation in accordance with regulations.
The way in which this brigade party committee dared to confront tough obstacles has also given rise to a chain reaction.  Several cadres who originally were unwilling to actively cooperate with the organization's allotment have now one by one also expressed their willingness to obey the organization's decisions.

Staff Writer, Shenzhen, July 18
Report by Li Guoliang and Huang Qi: For many years, Guangdong's Frontier Defense Unit Hospital, while doing a good job ensuring army medical service, has also done all it can to aid the masses who have found themselves in straitened circumstances, their compassion soothing the hearts of the common people everywhere.
This morning, a celebratory meeting to mark the conferring by the Public Security Ministry of a Collective Ward of Merit, Second Class, on Guangdong's Frontier Defense Unit Hospital, together with a public lecture on the exemplary deeds of the army in supporting the government and cherishing the people, was solemnly held in Shenzhen.
The Guangdong Frontier Unit Hospital, which has set itself the task of building socialist harmony, has successively established three fair-price hospitals specially aimed at migrant laborers in Buji, Longhua and Bao'an of Shenzhen.  The registration fee for migrant laborers seeking medical advice is only 1 yuan, and discounts of 20% are available for both tests and operations.
The hospital is provided with a special "Compassionate Service Vehicle," which takes peasant migrant patients to and from the clinic free of charge, and has rolled out a migrant peasant worker "Health Service Card," whereby each person needs to pay just 7 yuan a month to enjoy 12 types of basic medical treatment consultations and guarantees.

(Sports) Plants Change Season to Blossom "Out of Season" for the Beijing Olympic Games
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 28 (Correspondent Cui Junqiang) When the Olympic Games are held next year, Beijing is expected to turn into a sea of fresh flowers in hot and humid August.
By season-altering and other technological methods, scientific and research personnel have found a good way of adding more color to the Olympic Games.
At the "Practical Research into the Selection and Cultivation of New Plant Varieties for the Summer Olympics" project evaluation meeting held on the 28th in Beijing, the experts making the evaluation came to the conclusion that by the use of new rapid-control cultivation technologies, plant species or varieties with different natural flowering seasons could blossom at the same time in the summer and reach an optimum result for people to enjoy in August when the Beijing Olympics are held.
In the summer in Beijing, one can usually see only a dozen or so fresh flowers in full bloom, as the majority of flowering plants have either long withered or are far away from blossoming.
The scientific and research personnel worked hard to select 206 species and more than 400 varieties of plants for the Summer Olympic Games.
At the "2007 Olympic Games Plant and Flower Show" to be held in Beijing's Haidian park around the one year countdown before the Beijing Olympics open, a batch of plants meticulously cultivated by scientific and research personnel that previously could not naturally flower in August will welcome visitors with their gaily-colored flowers.
