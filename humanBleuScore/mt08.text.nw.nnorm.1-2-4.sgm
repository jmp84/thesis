<seg id="1"> Nearly 500 People Dead in Monsoon Floods in India</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> According to reports from officials and the media, the number of people who have died this year in India because of heavy monsoon rains has risen to 474.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The Press Trust of India quoted the government minister for relief and rehabilitation Kadam as revealing today that in the last week, the monsoon has started in all of India's states one after another, and that the financial losses and casualties have been serious in all areas.  Just in Maharashtra, the state which includes Mumbai, India's largest city, the number of people known to have died has now reached 358.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Reports say that Kadam made the above statement to media and journalists as he was making an inspection of Mumbai.</seg>
<seg id="5"> He said that Maharashtra, which is also India's biggest cotton-producing state, was entirely covered with a vast expanse of water, and there were cities and towns numbering 27 and about 2000 villages which had been hit by serious flooding.  More than 10000 affected people had been evacuated to safe shelters.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The whole of India, from south to north, started to progressively enter the monsoon season a week ago.  The residents of each state all greeted the heavy rains as relief at the end of a long drought, but didn't expect that the rain would come with unexpected violence, a real deluge.  Highways have become rivers; houses in low-lying areas have been surbmerged in the water; the transport system is nearly paralyzed.  To date, figures show that nearly 500 people have unfortunately lost their lives to the floods.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Wimbledon Tennis Tournament: Djokovic Forfeits, Nadal Through to Final</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Spanish clay court master Nadal today played Serbian wizard Djokovic in the men's singles semi-finals of the Wimbledon championships.  At the end of the match, Djokovic was unable to continue to play because he was injured, forfeited and withdrew from the match.  Nadal won and entered the final.  He will replay the titanic struggle for the championship at the French Open against the Swiss king of the tennis world, Federer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Djokovic called for medics to treat his back injury during the course of both his last-16 and quarter-final matches.  Today, when he had played to the third set, he again called for a medic to treat him because of a blister on his toe.  He later felt that he could not play on with the injury and decided to forfeit the game.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Fourth seed Djokovic's withdrawal from the game allowed second seed Nadal, who was leading 3-6, 6-1, 4-1, to claim the victory and progress through.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Apart from losing the first set after being broken once due to a slow start at the beginning of the match, Nadal was in a leading position throughout the second and third sets.</seg>

<seg id="2"> UN International Atomic Energy Agency deputy director-general Heinonen today held talks with Iranian officials in Tehran, once again trying to break the deadlock created by Iran's nuclear plans.</seg>
<seg id="3"> But Iranian President Ahmadinejad remained defiant under increasing pressure from the UN's further sanctions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Ahmadinejad asserted that Iran will not stop uranium enrichment, but welcomed these new talks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> He said: "Progress towards the installation of centrifuges can be delayed or speeded up.  This is an administrative issue.  But no-one should expect us to give up our rights.  We will not stop this progress."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> He made this remark after Heinonen arrived in Tehran.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Heinonen's aim on this trip is to establish a plan to resolve "the outstanding issues" caused by Iran's nuclear plans.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The UN has already imposed two sets of sanctions on Iran because Tehran failed to freeze its uranium enrichment operation.</seg>
</p>

<seg id="11"> Wu Xiqin said that Wang Yan's current exercises mainly focused on "sitting."  "She can maintain a seated posture on a bench for a while, but still not for too long."  (Correspondent Wang Chunqiu)</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> A lawyer for Berezovsky, the Russian oligarch in exile in London, Borovkov, announced on July 2 that the Russian Federal Security Service had formally issued a new charge against his client, accusing Berezovsky of "plotting to engineer a coup d'état and attempting a violent seizure of political power in Russia."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Borovkov pointed out that in April this year Berezovsky had announced during an interview with a journalist from the British "Guardian" newspaper that he was preparing to launch a "palace coup" in Russia, and confirmed that he was providing financial support to representatives of the right-wing elite opposed to the policies of the administration.</seg>
<seg id="4"> The Russian Federal Security Service's investigation bureau immediately launched a criminal investigation against Berezovsky under article 278 on "forcible seizure of power" of the Penal Code of the Russian Federation, and has formally brought forward related charges in Moscow's Savyolovsky court recently.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> It is reported that the Russian Procuratorate-General brought criminal charges against Berezovsky in February 2006, similarly based on the exiled oligarch's confirmation during an interview that he was attempting a seizure of state power by force in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="6"> As Berezovsky has remained in exile abroad, making it impossible to extradite him, Russia authorities temporarily suspended the investigation of the case in January 2007.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> On July 2, Moscow's Savyolovsky court began to hear another criminal case against the exiled oligarch.  The Russian Procuratorate-General accused Berezovsky of embezzling funds of 214000000 roubles from Aeroflot and laundering 16000000 roubles.  After the hearing the court decided to postpone judicial investigation into this case till July 12, and a state defense lawyer will be assigned for the defendant in this period.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Berezovsky believes that this is all a "farce," and has explicitly prohibited his defense lawyer from taking part in the court hearings.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> According to a report in the US media on the 15th, there has recently been a trend in the US towards a sharp increase in the number of reports of heart diseases and other adverse reactions caused by Avandia, an anti-diabetic medicine.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> In May this year the US Food and Drug Administration issued a safety warning, recommending that sufferers from diabetes exercise caution when using Avandia, because a scientist had published a research report in the edition of the New England Journal of Medicine that came out on May 21, saying that this best-selling drug could greatly increase the incidence of and death rate from heart disease among sufferers.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Consequently, the safety of Avandia has received close attention by doctors and patients.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Statistics show that in the approximately one month following the issuing of the safety warning, the US FDA had received 357 reports of adverse reactions caused by Avandia, of which 38 were reports of deaths.</seg>
<seg id="6"> And yet the FDA had received just 50 and 73 reports of adverse reactions in January and February this year respectively.</seg>
<seg id="7"> These adverse reactions ranged from being as trivial as getting blisters to as serious as sudden deaths from heart disease.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> However, the US FDA's pharmaceuticals experts believe that it would currently be premature to reach the conclusion that Avandia is not safe.</seg>
<seg id="9"> The FDA will hold a hearing into the safety of Avandia on July 30.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Avandia, which came on the market in 1999, is an insulin sensitizer, suitable for treating Type 2 diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="11"> Some 6000000 diabetes sufferers worldwide have taken or are taking Avandia.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Avandia's producer, the British company GlaxoSmithKline, continues to believe that Avandia is safe, and that for suffers "the benefits outweigh the drawbacks."</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> An official in the US Department of Defense said on the 23rd that due to the Iraq war and changes in the world situation, the US Department of Defense is reconsidering a plan drawn up in 2002 to cut the number of US troops in Europe by approximately half.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The US media cited a Department of Defense official as saying that due to the ongoing Iraq war and the worsening US relations with Russia and Iran, Department of Defense leaders have raised doubts about the feasibility of plans to cut troops in Europe.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> In 2002 the then Secretary of Defense Rumsfield announced that the US would reduce troop numbers in Europe from the original 113000 to 71000 before 2012, in order to create a new-style army with "fewer, but better" soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="5"> The US army's total forces in Europe have currently fallen to 100000 people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> But in June this year, Commander Craddock of the US Army Headquarters in Europe submitted a report to the current secretary of defense, Gates, raising doubts over the above-mentioned reduction plan.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The report said that while US army forces are being reduced in Europe, many military units would be deployed on a rotation basis to Iraq and Afghanistan for combat, leading to a shortfall in US troops in Europe to such an extent that there would be no way to develop normal cooperation with European allies.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The report recommended halting the plan to reduce US troops in Europe.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Relevant US experts believe that the above-mentioned phenomenon shows that the prolonged and unresolved Iraq war has disrupted the original US military's restructuring plans.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> In order to better implement the "Food Hygiene Law" and the State Council's "Resolution on Further Strengthening Food Safety Work," the Ministry of Health has launched a hygiene supervision status publicity system as a pilot project in the restaurant trade in ten areas, namely Haidian district in Beijing municipality, Tianjin municipality, Taizhou city and Jiangyan city in Jiangsu, Hangzhou city in Zhejiang province, Luoyang city in Henan province, Wuhan city in Hubei province, Haikou city and Sanya city in Hainan province, and Chengdu city in Sichuan province.</seg>
<seg id="3"> This system will also be gradually rolled out nationwide.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The restaurant trade hygiene supervision publicity system conducts on-the-spot supervision investigations on the basis of day-to-day hygiene supervision in 9 important areas of hygiene, namely restaurant trade work units' hygiene permits, their hygiene management systems, their hygiene management personnel, the health certificates of the personnel involved, food product quality and labeling, health protection in the food-processing process, environmental hygiene in processing areas, the cleaning and disinfection of kitchenware, and the acquisition of purchase documentation for the main raw materials used.

<seg id="1"> People's Armed Force Department in Jingjiang City Sets up a Platform to Raise the Quality of Their Full-time Cadres</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Staff Writer, Report by Cao Jiawei and Zhu Chunbin: On June 18, at a training class for People's Armed Force full-time cadres in Jingjiang city in Jiangsu province, Lu Yuqing, leader of the People's Armed force department of Xilai township, delivered a training lecture "Winning a Psychological War under Informationalized Conditions" that received a unanimous favorable assessment from the trainees.</seg>
<seg id="3"> This was a new change that was brought about by the city's People's Armed Force when it has put more pressure on its cadres based on the reality of their positions in an effort to raise People's Armed Force cadres' comprehensive quality.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> At the beginning of this year, the People's Armed force party committee discovered during investigation and research at the grassroots level that some of the People's Armed Force cadres had served for a long time, had too many concurrent duties, and had not put their chief energies into the armed force work.</seg>
<seg id="5"> For this reason, they have adopted methods including centralized training, replacing training with meetings, and relying on local party schools to conduct training, thus regularly training military cadres, in an effort to resolve problems such as the narrow knowledge base and the uniform focus of the professional quality of military cadres.</seg>
<seg id="6"> In combination with the central work, they boldly assign tasks to military cadres and put more pressure on them, and raise their performance by on-the-job training.</seg>
<seg id="7"> At the same time, they have actively coordinated with local organizational departments and jointly drafted the "People's Armed Forces Cadres' Competition for Jobs Scheme," and explicitly stipulated that the leaders of People's Armed Forces departments must join the party committee of the same level and cannot concurrently take on other jobs.</seg>
<seg id="8"> They have set up a military cadres' restructuring exchange mechanism to promptly regulate exchanges on some older military cadres who are not suitable for grassroots People's Armed forces work, and promote and use some comrades of good comprehensive quality and strong work ability.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Not long ago, a domestic gap was filled by the underwater boat-welding technology invented and developed by the People's Militia technology platoon under the leadership of the secretary of the armed department of the New Century Shipbuilding Company Limited, Chen Yisong, who was exceptionally promoted as the company's armed department leader.</seg>

<seg id="3"> Today, this correspondent saw from the launch ceremony of the Armed Police 07-series uniform and the dressing demonstration event that the current uniform change altogether includes 105 types of clothing in four main categories, namely ceremonial attire, everyday uniform, drill uniform, and symbols and accessories.</seg>
<seg id="4"> The color of the uniform is being adjusted from the current olive green to deep olive green.  Ornamental trim is being sewn on all sleeve cuffs and pant side hems.  The overall design feels very modern, and national clothing specification standards have been consulted while drawing up specifications.</seg>
<seg id="5"> The large-brimmed hat of female officers and soldiers will be changed into a hat with a curled brim; the everyday winter clothing of police officers will be changed from a buttoned-up collar style to an open collar style and everyday summer clothing will be changed into a form that is tight at the waist; and everyday spring and fall clothing will be changed into a hunting dress design.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The newly added name tags, rank and qualifications badges, national defense military service badges and ribbons, as well as redesigned cap insignia, chest symbols, tie toggles, epaulets and sleeve insignia have strengthened the identification function of the clothing and improved its esthetic appearance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The Armed Police will be issued with their 07-series uniform over 3 years.</seg>
<seg id="8"> By August 1, 2007, police officers, civilian cadres and the National Flag Guard, military orchestras, and song-and-dance troupes will be issued with their ceremonial attire in keeping with the entire military.

<seg id="1"> "Small, Scattered, Far and Direct" Education Coordination Zones Go into Operation in a Second Artillery Unit Base</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Staff Writer, Report by Xue Bingjian and Correspondent Xu Yeqing: The situation in the "small, scattered, far and direct" units where education organization is difficult, resources are meager, and each fends for itself, will become history at a second artillery unit base.</seg>
<seg id="3"> This correspondent learned recently that following a half-year pilot project, this base has handed down "The Method of Fully Implementing 'An Outline for Ideological and Political Education'."  A number of ideological and political education coordination zones covering all the "small, scattered, far and direct" units in the base have officially been brought into operation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> In order to push ahead with the effective implementation of "An Outline for Ideological and Political Education," the base organized resources at the beginning of the year to conduct in-depth investigation and research of the ideological and political education situation in "small, scattered, far and direct" units.  They combed through important issues that influence and restrict the education time, personnel and results, and initially established this new-style education model of coordination zones for the "small, scattered, far and direct" units.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The concrete approach of coordination zones is to break down the organizational boundaries among units and set up a brigade and regiment-level unit to take the lead in the areas where the "small, scattered, far and direct" units are relatively concentrated, and conduct an integrated program for thematic education, with units falling under different hierarchies coming together in nearby places for lectures or using the help of video link-up systems for remote discussions.</seg>
<seg id="6"> They have adopted a method that integrates taking turns in giving lessons and competing for posts, and unifying the allocation of educational resources.  In each area the use of educational hardware will be integrated, and each unit's materials, data and educational experiences will be shared and exchanged with those of others, with regular organization in each area of typical tour reports and exchanges of what they got from the study by the officers and men.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Every coordination zone has set up a devoted educational liaison person and a part-time educational information gatherer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> On this basis, each coordination zone has also set up systems for seeking assistance on difficult issues, holding joint discussions on major educational themes, reporting critical ideological situations, and assessing tests and evaluations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Zhang Shengmin, the director of the base's political department, told this correspondent that constructing political education coordination zones has both reduced the waste of educational resources and deepened the impact of education.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Some political instructors fear they will lose marks in front of officers and men from other units and have taken the initiative to study new things and seek new educational methods.</seg>
<seg id="11"> The officers and men receiving the education have also enthusiastically digested the educational content, out of concern over expressing themselves in layman's language in front of the officers and men of friendly neighboring units during discussion and analysis.</seg>
<seg id="12"> In this way, the enthusiasm of the people giving and receiving education has been both effectively stimulated.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> Staff Writer, Report by Zhang Junhong and Liu Hongjun: On July 17, led by vice-chief engineer Zhang Weiliang of a North China Sea fleet repair brigade, 31 of the brigade's long-serving frontline repair sailors happily stepped on a train to go to Beidaihe for a period of rest and recuperation.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Luo Xiangming, an NCO class, happily told this writer, "That the brigade's leaders care about and cherish the sailors deeply moves us.  After a period of rest and recuperation, we will definitely work doubly hard!"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> This is actually the first time that this brigade has organized rest and recuperation for grassroots sailors.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Not long ago, the brigade commander Yao Qingsheng went down to the grassroots units and saw that sailors responsible for repair work were braving high temperatures to carry out equipment maintenance and repair work, deeply moving Yao Qingsheng.</seg>
<seg id="6"> "As the sailors work selflessly, the party committee should care about and cherish the sailors, and take responsibility for the sailors' health."  At a meeting of the party committee, Yao Qingsheng's words were endorsed by everyone.</seg>
<seg id="7"> After looking into the matter, the party committee reached a decision to give the entire R&amp;R quota allocated to the brigade by senior authorities to the sailors doing repair work on the frontline.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Staff Writer</seg>
<seg id="3"> Report by Wang Weiqin and Specially Contracted Correspondent Li Deying: On July 25, this writer observed in a service support company of the Ji'nan Military Command that invitations for an army engineering tender, details of financial expenditure, promotions of cadres, non-commissioned officers being admitted to the Party and other major matters were written up on a bulletin board, and hung up conspicuously in a display cabinet.</seg>
<seg id="4"> As Political Commissar Su Chengsen explained, this is a concrete measure adopted by the section to promote a system where things are done openly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> At the beginning of this year, the unit party committee drew up measures including "Two-way Supervision Between the Organization and the Grassroots" and "Publicizing Sensitive Issues" to strengthen the construction of the party spirit and honest government, requiring that for all significant issues that involve the direct interests of the officers and men and army development, the opinions of grassroots officers and men are first heard before decisions are reached, and that standards, procedures, and results etc of the handling of the matters are made public from start to finish in line with the circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The unit has installed a suggestion box and a bulletin board, and has opened a "message board" on its Intranet to collect everyone's views and recommendations in an extensive way.</seg>
<seg id="7"> At the beginning of the year, as the renovation project of the soldiers' barracks was about to start, before the work began, the party committee organ extensively solicited the views of the officers and men, and then released the information on inviting bids, implementing a system of open tenders.</seg>
<seg id="8"> This both saved money and won the support of the officers and men.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Doing things in an open and fair way has driven the formation of a good atmosphere at the grassroots.</seg>
<seg id="10"> In this unit, the grassroots company insists on making regular public announcements and notices, no matter whether they are issues as big as the determination of "hot-button" sensitive matters, or as trivial as personal vacations to visit relatives or daily income and expenditure in the mess accounts, thus taking the initiative to receive the supervision of the masses.</seg>

<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan,  July 11 (Correspondents Liu Yang and Pi Shuchu)</seg>
<seg id="3"> When 13 pilots  handed in their resignations, their "boss," the China Eastern Airlines Wuhan Co. Ltd asked them for compensation for a huge sum of up to 105000000.  This is the largest sum claimed in damages so far in a labor dispute case in Hubei province.</seg>
<seg id="4"> The Labor Dispute Arbitration Commission of Hubei province is currently trying this case.</seg>
<seg id="5"> In May this year, 13 pilots with China Eastern Airlines Wuhan Company in succession handed in their resignations, which were rejected by the company.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Soon afterwards, the pilots applied one after another at the beginning of June to the Labor Dispute Arbitration Commission of Hubei province for labor arbitration, requesting for a ruling that their labor relationship with China Eastern Airlines Wuhan Company be terminated.</seg>
<seg id="7"> After China Eastern Airlines Wuhan Company received notice of the suit, it advanced a counterclaim and requested that the 13 pilots pay for losses caused by their breaking their labor contract agreements and canceling their labor contracts, ranging from more than 6000000 yuan to 10000000 yuan respectively, totaling 105000000 yuan.</seg>
<seg id="8"> It has been learned that the labor contract the pilots signed with China Eastern Airlines was of unfixed duration.  Unless the conditions agreed in the labor contract for breaking off or canceling the agreement applied, the labor contract was to remain in force until the pilots' legal retirement age.</seg>
<seg id="9"> The Labor Dispute Arbitration Commission of Hubei province will try and deal with this case as a suit and a countersuit together, and it is hoped that the hearing will be over by August 8.</seg>

<seg id="4"> According to a report by the Korean Central News Agency, North Korea's military representative and senior colonel in the Korean People's Army, Pak Rim Su, brought forward a proposal during that day's contact to set up a joint fishing zone in North Korea's West Sea between Yonphyong island to Paekryong island, and gave a detailed explanation of the rationale for it.</seg>
<seg id="5"> He said that in order to set up a joint fishing zone, it is necessary to implement the principles such as those of seeking maximum common national prosperity and benefits and of safeguarding peaceful and secure fishing operations.</seg>
<seg id="6"> While talking about the issue of the bilaterally disputed maritime border, Pak Rim Su said that in order to prevent military conflict between the two sides in the West Sea, the two sides should renounce the maritime borders they have hitherto insisted on, recognize and respect each other's rights to territorial seas, and accept as the basis for negotiations the relevant agreements between North Korea and South Korea, the Korean armistice agreement, and internationally recognized law.</seg>
<seg id="7"> He said that the "persistent standpoint" of the North Korean military was to promptly draw up military safeguard measures in order to promote cooperative exchanges between North and South Korea.</seg>
<seg id="8"> He said that the South Korean side should adopt military measures right now to ensure that North Korean civilian vessels can sail directly south from Haeju port and freely pass through the Jeju Straits.</seg>
<seg id="9"> This has been the second round of military talks and routine contacts held recently between both North and South Korea since the 10th of this month.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Today is the end of the one-month state of emergency implemented by the Palestinian Authority after Hamas militants attacked and occupied the Gaza Strip.  Prime Minister Fayyad tendered resignation temporarily, but was thereupon tasked with responsibility for setting up a new government.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Agriculture and Social Affairs Minister Habash told AFP, "Prime Minister Fayyad submitted his written resignation to President Abbas.  The president accepted it and at the same time asked him to set up a new cabinet government with responsibility for handling daily affairs."</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> On July 2, Borovkov, lawyer of the Russian oligarch Berezovsky exiled in London, announced that the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation has made a new formal charge accusing his client Berezovksky of "secretly planning a national political coup and attempting to violently take over Russian political authority. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Borovkov pointed out that in April this year, in an interview with a reporter from the British The Guardian, Berezovsky announced that he was prepared to initiate a "palace revolution" in Russia and confirmed that he provided financial support to the right wing elite representatives opposing the policies of the party in power.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Following this, the Investigation Office of the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation launched a criminal investigation against Berezovsky according to article 278 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation,"seizing power through violence."  In the last few days they formally lodged a corresponding indictment with Moscow's Savyolovsky court.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Reports say that in February 2006 the Russian Federation Chief Prosecutors Office issued a criminal indictment against Berezovsky on the same premise that the exiled oligarch confirmed in an interview that he planned to take over political power in Russia by force.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Since Berezovsky has continuously been exiled abroad and could not be extradited, in January 2007 the Russians temporarily terminated investigation of this case.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> On July 2, Russia's Savyolovsky court commenced hearing another criminal case against the exiled oligarch.  The Russian Chief Prosecutors Office accused Berezovsky of embezzling 214000000 Rubles from Aeroflot and laundering 16000000 Rubles.  After hearing the evidence the court decided to adjourn until July 12 when they will launch a court investigation.  In the meantime, they will assign a state defense attorney to the accused.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Berezovsky believes this is all a "farce" and categorically forbids his defense attorney from taking part in the hearing.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> According to US media reports on the 15th, the number of reports in the USA of heart disease and other adverse reactions caused by the anti-diabetes drug Avandia has recently seen a dramatic rise.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The US Food and Drug Administration issued a safety warning in May this year suggesting that diabetes patients use Avandia cautiously, because scientists published a research report in the issue of New England Journal of Medicine published on May 21 that said this blockbuster drug will greatly increase the heart disease incidence rate and death rate of patients.</seg>
<seg id="4"> As a result, the safety of Avandia came under close scrutiny from doctors and patients.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Statistics show within around one month of issuing the safety warning, the US FDA received 357 reports of adverse reactions caused by Avandia, of those 38 were fatality reports.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Whereas in January and February this year, the FDA received only 50 and 73 reports of adverse reactions respectively.</seg>
<seg id="7"> These adverse reactions were as minor as blistering and as major as sudden cardiac death.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> However, experts at the US FDA believe that now it is still early to arrive at the conclusion that Avandia is unsafe.</seg>
<seg id="9"> On July 30, the FDA will hold a hearing concerning the safety of Avandia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Introduced to the market in 1999, Avandia is a kind of insulin sensitizer suitable for the treatment of Type II diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="11"> In the entire world there are about 6000000 diabetes patients who have taken or are taking Avandia.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Avandia's manufacturer, the British GlaxoSmithKline Company, has always considered that Avandia is safe and that for patients "the benefits are greater than the risks."</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> A US Department of Defense official said on the 23rd that due to the Iraq war and the change in the world situation, the U.S. Department of Defense is currently reconsidering its plan, formulated in 2002, to cut the number of US troops posted in Europe by roughly half.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> US media quoted a Department of Defense official saying, because the Iraq war is still in progress and US relations with Russia and Iran have worsened, those at the leadership level of the Department of Defense questioned the viability of the plan to cut troops posted in Europe.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> In 2002, the Secretary of Defense at the time, Rumsfeld, announced that before 2012 the US will cut the number of troops posted in Europe from the original 113000 people to 71000 people, in order to build a "smaller but superior" new model army.</seg>
<seg id="5"> At present, the total military strength of the US Army posted in Europe has already been reduced to 100000 people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> However, in June this year, Chief of Staff Craddock at US European Command Headquarter submitted a report to the current Secretary of Defense Gates, raising doubts about the abovementioned reduction plan.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The report said that while the military strength of US troops posted in Europe was being reduced, many of the units were rotated and transferred to fight in Iraq and Afghanistan.  This caused a shortfall in US troops posted in Europe and even made it impossible to carry out cooperation with their European allies as normal.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The report suggested terminating the plan to reduce US troops posted in Europe.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Associated experts in the United States believe that the above phenomenon indicates that the prolonged delay in resolving the Iraq war has already upset the original adjustment plan of the US troops.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Jingjiang City People's Armed Forces Department Builds Platform to Improve Quality of Their Full-time Cadres</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Staff Report by Cao Jiawei and Zhu Chunbin: On June 18, in a class where Jiangsu province Jingjiang City People's Armed Forces full-time cadres assembled for training, a tutorial course on "Winning the Psychological War under Informationalized Conditions" taught by Lu Yuqing, director of the People's Armed Forces Department from Xilai town, received unanimous acclaim from participating students.</seg>
<seg id="3"> This is a new change achieved by the People's Armed Force Department of this city through giving their full-time cadre actual pressure appropriate to their positions in an effort to improve their overall quality .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> At the beginning of this year, during a grassroots survey, this People's Armed Forces Department Party Committee discovered that some full-time cadres have worked for a long number of years, held too many posts concurrently and were not putting their main effort into doing People's Armed Forces work.</seg>
<seg id="5"> For this reason, they adopted centralized training, held meetings instead of lectures, relied on local party schools to perform training and other methods, and periodically carried out training for full-time cadre in an effort to solve such problems as the full-time cadres' narrow sphere of knowledge, singular professional capability, etc.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Based on core work, they boldly assigned duties and increased the pressure on People's Armed Forces full-time cadres, and through on-the-job training improved their work competence.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Meanwhile, they actively coordinated with local organization departments and jointly drew up the "People's Armed Forces Full-time Cadre Achieving Position through Competition Plan."  This clarifies the regulation that the director of the People's Armed Forces Department must enter the party committee leading group at the same grade and may not concurrently hold any other offices.</seg>
<seg id="8"> A full-time cadre rotation arrangement system was established to promptly rotate and exchange older full-time cadre unable to adapt to grassroots People's Armed Forces work, while those comrades with good overall character and strong work capabilities were given promotions and put to use.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Not long ago, Chen Yisong, the secretary in charge of the People's Armed Forces Department at New Century Shipyard Ltd., led a militia technical squad that innovated and developed an underwater vessel welding technology which made up for a deficiency in this nation.  He was given an accelerated promotion to director of the company's People's Armed Forces Department.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Staff Report by Xue Bingjian and Correspondent Xu Yeqing: The phenomenon of difficult organization, few resources, and individual operation in educating the "small, scattered, remote and direct" units will become a thing of the past at a Second Artillery base.</seg>
<seg id="3"> In recent days, this reporter learned that after half a year of trials, this base issued "Methods of Implementing the 'Ideological and Political Education Syllabus'" to the grassroots levels.  A number of ideological and political education coordination sections covering all the "small, scattered, remote and direct" units at the base were officially set in operation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> To promote effective implementation of the "Ideological and Political Education Syllabus," at the beginning of the year, this base used their organizational abilities to conduct an in-depth investigation into the current situation of ideological and political education in "small, scattered, remote and direct" units at the base.  They combed through the key problems affecting and restricting education time, staff and effectiveness, and preliminarily formed this kind of new education format of coordination sections for "small, scattered, remote and direct" units.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The specific modus operandi of the coordination section is to break down unit organization boundaries, specify a brigade or regiment level unit to take the lead in a region with relatively concentrated "small, scattered, remote and direct" units in unified planning of topical education.  Units having different subordinate relationships either attend classes nearby together or hold remote discussions by way of a video system.</seg>
<seg id="6"> A combined method of giving classes in rotation and competing for posts is adopted to unify allocation of educational strength.  Educational hardware in parts of a region was used jointly; and the information, data and educational experiences of all units were shared and exchanged.  Typical reporting tours in parts of the region are periodically organized, and officers and soldiers exchange what they have learned.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Each coordination section has established a full-time education liaison and a part-time educational information collector.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> On this basis, each coordination section has also set up systems to seek help on difficult problems, discuss important educational subject matters, report urgent ideological situations, and to test and appraise.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Director of the political department at the base, Zhang Shengmin, told reporters that establishing political education coordination sections has not only reduced wastage of educational resources, but has also deepened the effect of the education.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Some politics instructors were afraid to lose points in front of officers and men from other units, so they took the initiative to learn new knowledge and seek out new methods of education.</seg>
<seg id="11"> The officers and men receiving education also actively digested the educational content lest they sounded unprofessional in front of officers and men from neighboring units in their discussions and analyses.</seg>
<seg id="12"> In so doing, the enthusiasm of the educators and the educated has been both effectively stirred up.</seg>

<seg id="3"> Report by Wang Weiqin and Special Correspondent Li Deying: On July 25, at a Service Support Company of Jinan Military Command, the writer saw a public notice board written on with army engineering tenders, financial expenses, cadre promotions, NCOs joining the party, and other important issues prominently hung up in a display window.</seg>
<seg id="4"> As introduced by political commissar Su Chengsen, this is a concrete action taken by this department to push forward the open office work system.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> At the beginning of this year, this army party committee formulated the "Office and Grassroots Bidirectional Supervision," "Public Notices of Sensitive Issue," and other measures to strengthen the building of party conduct and clean government.  These require that important issues involving the immediate interests of officers and soldiers and army construction are only decided after listening to the opinion of grassroots officers and soldiers.  Also, depending upon the situation, the entire process of office standards, procedures, results, etc. are made public.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The army set up a suggestion box and notice board, opened up a "message board" on their Intranet and extensively collected everybody's opinions and suggestions.</seg>
<seg id="7"> At the beginning of the year, the soldier's dormitory refurbishment project started.  Before work got underway, the party committee extensively solicited opinion from officers and soldiers, and then issued a public tender notice and carried out public tender bidding.</seg>
<seg id="8"> This both saved expenditures and won the support of officers and soldiers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Conducting work openly and fairly has spurred a good atmosphere to take shape at the grassroots level.</seg>
<seg id="10"> In this army, whether it is settling upon work as large as 'hot issue' sensitive affairs or as small as taking personal vacation time to visit one's relatives, the everyday expenditure on mess accounts and other items, the grassroots company persists with scheduled public notices and publications, and take the initiative to accept mass supervision.</seg>

<seg id="3"> Thirteen pilots submitted their resignation, and "the boss," China Eastern Airlines Wuhan Limited Liability Company, wrote out a compensation sheet for as high as the massive amount of 105000000.

<seg id="5"> In May this year, 13 pilots at China Eastern Wuhan Company successively submitted their resignation and were refused by the company.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Subsequently, in the beginning of June, the pilots one by one submitted labor arbitration applications to the Hubei Province Labor Dispute Arbitration Committee, petitioning for an arbitration decision to terminate their working relationship with China Eastern Wuhan Company.</seg>
<seg id="7"> After China Eastern Wuhan Company received the notice to respond to the lawsuit, they submitted a countersuit demanding the 13 pilots to separately pay them varying consequential damages of over 6000000 to over 10000000 yuan, in a total of 105000000 yuan, for dissolving the employment contract in breach of employment contract stipulations.</seg>

<seg id="4"> The reporter learned from the meeting that the Price Administration and other departments of the city jointly promulgated a price cap mainly because the rate of increase of beef noodles was too high and had gone beyond the ability to afford of ordinary residents.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Allegedly, the rate of increase of beef noodles had reached 20 percent this time. Statistics showed that this was the largest rate of increase within the shortest time since the early 1980's when the price of beef noodles in Lanzhou was raised for the first time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> "The government's action was a consideration of the economic ability of ordinary residents in the area. We promulgated the price cap after conducting a cost survey," the director of the Price Administration of Lanzhou municipal government said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> On the 26th of last month, four departments of Lanzhou including the Price Administration, the Administrative Bureau of Industry and Commerce, and the Bureau of Public Health jointly implemented a price cap on the beef noodles in the city. The news drew strong concern once it was announced.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> According to investigation, the objective of the forum was to widely solicit opinions from all circles to invite opinions and suggestions for the promulgation of specific regulatory measure in the next step. In addition, based on information released, Lanzhou will hold a press conference tomorrow.</seg>
<seg id="9"> It will be the second press conference for the price increase in beef noodles held by Lanzhou City.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Borovkov, attorney of Russian magnate Berezovsky who is in exile in London, announced on July 2 that the Russian Federal Security Service has formally indicted his client with a new charge by accusing Berezovsky of "conspiring to stage a coup with an attempt to seize political power in Russia by force".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Borovkov said that during an interview with a reporter of the Guardian  in Britain this April, Berezovsky announced that he was preparing to mount a "palace coup" in Russia and confirmed that he was providing financial support to representatives of the Rightist elites who opposed to the policies of the authorities.</seg>
<seg id="4"> The Investigation Directorate of the Russian Federal Security Service immediately initiated a criminal case against Berezovsky under Article 278  "forcible seizure of power" of the Penal Code of the Russian Federation and formally filed a corresponding charge with Moscow's Savelovsky Court recently.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Allegedly, the Russian Office of the Prosecutor-General had filed a criminal charge against Berezovsky in February 2006 with the same evidence that the exiled tycoon confirmed in an interview his attempt to seize political power in Russia by force.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Since Berezovsky had been in exile ever since and could not be extradited, Russia temporarily terminated the investigation of the case in January 2007.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> On July 2, Moscow's Savelovsky Court began the hearing of another criminal case against the exiled magnate. The Russian Office of the Prosecutor-General charged Berezovsky with embezzling Russian airline Aeroflot of £ 214000000 in capital and laundering £ 16000000. After hearing the evidence, the court decided to postpone the court investigation to July 12. It will assign a state-appointed defense attorney for the defendant here.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Berezovsky argued that these are all "farces" and clearly prohibited his defense attorney to take part in the court hearings.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> According to reports of U.S. media on the 15th, the number of reports on adverse reactions caused by diabetes drug Avandia such as heart attack has significantly increased in the United States in recent days.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a safety warning this May suggesting diabetics to take precaution in taking Avandia because scientists published a study report in the May 21 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine stating that this best-selling drug will greatly increase patients' risk of heart attack and death rate.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Doctors and patients thus paid close attention to the safety of Avandia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Statistics showed that within approximately a month after the safety warning was issued, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration received 357 reports on adverse reactions caused by Avandia, 38 of which were reports of death.</seg>
<seg id="6"> While in January and February this year, the Food and Drug Administration only received 50 and 73 cases of adverse reaction reports respectively.</seg>
<seg id="7"> These adverse reactions range from minor one of having blisters to serious one of sudden death from heart attack.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> However, drug experts at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration believed that it is now still too early to draw a conclusion that Avandia is unsafe.</seg>
<seg id="9"> The Food and Drug Administration will hold a hearing on the safety of Avandia on July 30.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Avandia, an insulin sensitizer, was introduced in 1999. It is suitable for treating type II diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="11"> There are approximately 6000000 diabetics worldwide who have taken or are currently taking Avandia.</seg>
<seg id="12"> GlaxoSmithKline, the British manufacturer of Avandia, has always considered Avandia safe and 'has more benefits than harm' for the patients.</seg>

<seg id="2"> An official of the U.S. Department of Defense said on the 23rd that due to the War on Iraq and changes in global situation, the U.S. Department of Defense is reconsidering its plan to cut approximately half of the U.S. troops in Europe formulated in 2002.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> U.S. media quoted a Department of Defense official as saying that since the War on Iraq is still going on and the US-Russia and US-Iran relationships are deteriorating, the leadership at the Department of Defense raised doubts about the feasibility of the plan to cut the troops in Europe.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> In 2002, the then Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld announced that the United States would reduce the original 113000 troops in Europe to 71000 by 2012 in order to build a new "small and elite" army.</seg>
<seg id="5"> The number of U.S. troops in Europe is currently reduced to 100000.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> However, Craddock, commander-in-chief of U.S. European Command, submitted a report to the current Secretary of Defense Gates in June questioning the above reduction plan.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The report said that while the U.S. troops in Europe are being reduced, many troops are be rotated into Iraq and Afghanistan to fight, thus causing a shortage in U.S. troops in Europe. As a result, they cannot cooperate normally with their European allies.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The report suggested a halt to the plan to cut U.S. troops in Europe.</seg>

<seg id="8"> they established the adjustment and exchange mechanism for cadres of the Department of People's Armed Forces. For cadres of the Department of People's Armed Forces who are relatively old and cannot adapt to grassroots armed forces work, they made adjustments and exchanges immediately. For compatriots who had good comprehensive qualities and strong work abilities, they promoted and employed them.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Not long ago, Chen Yisong, Secretary of the New Century Shipbuilding Co., Ltd.

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> This newspaper, reported by Xue Bingjian, Reporter Xu Yeqing: The phenomena of difficult organization, limited resources, and lack of coordination in education encountered by small, scattered, remote, and independent units will become history for a base of the Second Artillery.</seg>
<seg id="3"> The reporters recently learned that after half a year of pilot, the base promulgated the Enactment Measures to Implement Ideological and Political Education Syllabus that cover several ideological and political education cooperation zones in all small, scattered, remote, and independent units at the base. The measures are officially in operation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> In order to promote the effective implementation of the Ideological and Political Education Syllabus, the base allocated resources to conduct an in-depth survey on the ideological and political education situation in small, scattered, remote, and independent units in the beginning of the year. They sorted out key issues that affected and restricted the time, personnel, and effects of the education and initially formed the new educational model of cooperation zones for small, scattered, remote, and independent units.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The details of the cooperation zones are, break away from the restrictions of authorized force of the units, and designate a unit at the brigade or regiment level in a sub-area where small, scattered, remote, and independent units are relatively concentrated to take the lead to conduct standardized planning of thematic education. Units under different affiliations will attend classes together nearby or to hold long-distance discussions by means of video system.</seg>
<seg id="6"> They adopt the practice of integrating teaching rotation and competing for job positions to conduct consolidated allocation of education force. Education hardware in the sub-area is put under centralized use. Information and data of all units, as well as education experiences are shared and exchanged. Report tours by model sub-areas and sharing of educational experiences among officers and men are regularly organized.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Each cooperation unit has set up full-time education contacts and part-time education information gatherers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> On this foundation, all cooperation zones have also established systems for seeking help in difficult questions, discussions on major educational topics, notification of emergency ideological situations, and examination and assessment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Zhang Shengmin, chief of the Political Department at the base, told reporters that the establishment of political education cooperation zones both reduces waste in educational resources and deepens educational effects.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Some political instructors worry that they will lose points in front of officers and men from outside units, so they take the initiative to learn new knowledge and explore new educational methods.</seg>
<seg id="11"> Officers and men being taught also actively digest educational contents in fear that they will sound unprofessional in front of officers and men from neighboring units during discussion, differentiation, and analysis.</seg>
<seg id="12"> In this case, the enthusiasm of both the educators and the ones who receive the education is effectively stimulated.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Early this year, in order to strengthen the building of Party's style and of a clean government, the Party committee of this unit formulated measures including the Two-Way Supervision between State Organs and Grassroots and the Notification of the Public on Sensitive Matters. They requested decisions on major issues that involve personal interests of officers and soldiers and the building of the unit to be made after seeking opinions from grassroots soldiers as well as disclosure of the entire course of work including standards applied, procedures, and results based on the situation.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The unit has set up a suggestion box and notification board, as well as established a "message board" on the LAN to gather opinions and suggestions of the people on a large scale.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The soldiers' dormitory renovation project began at the beginning of the year. Before the project started, the Party committee solicited opinions from officers and soldiers extensively and then released bidding information and implemented open bidding.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The measure had saved fund and won the support of the officers and soldiers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Openness and fairness in work has promoted the formation of good morals at grassroots.</seg>
<seg id="10"> In this unit, whether they are major matters such as determination of central and sensitive issues or minor matters such as going home to visit relatives or taking vacation of an individual and daily expenses on food accounts, the grassroots companies still insist on notifying and announcing the matters regularly and subjecting to public monitoring conscientiously.</seg>

<seg id="3"> China Eastern Airlines Wuhan Corp. Ltd., the "employer" of 13 pilots who resigned, claimed a huge compensation of 105000000 yuan against them. This labor dispute case involves the biggest claim ever in Hubei Province.</seg>
<seg id="4"> The Hubei Labor Dispute Arbitration Committee is currently hearing the case.</seg>
<seg id="5"> In May, 13 pilots working for the China Eastern Airlines Wuhan Corp. Ltd. resigned one after another. Their resignations were declined by the company.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Soon afterwards, in early June, the pilots submitted applications for labor arbitration with the Hubei Labor Arbitration Committee successively requesting a ruling to terminate the labor relations with the China Eastern Airlines Wuhan Corp. Ltd.</seg>
<seg id="7"> After the China Eastern Airlines Wuhan Corp. Ltd. received the Notice of Charge, it filed a counterclaim demanding the 13 pilots to pay the company for damages ranging from over 6000000 yuan to 10000000 yuan respectively incurred by the violation of agreements in the labor contracts and the termination of the labor contracts with a total of 105000000 yuan.</seg>
<seg id="8"> It was learned that the contracts the pilots signed with the China Eastern Airlines were ones without fixed time limit. Unless termination conditions or renunciation conditions agreed upon in the labor contracts appear, the labor contracts will be effective until the pilots reach legal retirement age.</seg>
<seg id="9"> The Hubei Labor Arbitration Committee will hear and handle the case together as an appeal and a counterclaim. The hearing is expected to end by August 8.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> US Treasury Secretary Paulson arrived yesterday on a visit to China.  The US is currently doing all it can to persuade China to carry out further necessary economic reforms and work on environmental protection.  The renminbi exchange rate is an issue that will receive particular attention.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> US diplomats say that Paulson first visited Xining, capital city of China's large northwestern province of Qinghai.</seg>
<seg id="4"> China is currently carrying out a series of plans for environmental protection near the largest freshwater lake in Qinghai Province.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Today Paulson will move on to Beijing to discuss pushing for progress in the US-China Strategic Economic Dialogue started last year and other issues with Chinese chief officials.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The US-China Strategic Economic Dialogue mainly discusses economic, environmental protection and other issues.  Yet, the most important is the issue of the renminbi exchange rate.  US congressmen believe that the renminbi is excessively undervalued.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The trade deficit between the US and China is quickly escalating.  Internal pressure within the US is gradually rising, and congressmen are ready to take retributive action to resist what they call China's unfair trade policies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Last week the US Senate Finance Committee overwhelmingly approved a bill requiring the Treasury to identify a list of countries with "fundamentally misaligned" currency exchange rates.  This opens the door for potential economic sanctions to be brought against Beijing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> US congressmen say that the renminbi is undervalued, which makes the price of goods that China sells to the US extremely cheap, and adds to the trade imbalance between the US and China.  Last year the US's trade deficit with China reached US $ 232500000000.</seg>

<seg id="1"> F1 "Spy Case" Hearing Finished Yesterday; McLaren Escapes Penalties for Now</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Last night Beijing time, the special hearing held by the FIA World Motor Sports Council in Paris over the Ferrari engineer spy case came to a close.  McLaren, who had been summoned, managed a lucky escape: the council decided not to impose any penalty on McLaren for the time being.</seg>
<seg id="3"> The FIA official website published a statement after the hearing, saying: "Vodafone McLaren Mercedes was in possession of confidential Ferrari information, but at present there is insufficient evidence to show that this information was used improperly in the FIA Formula One World Championship.  Therefore no penalty will be imposed."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> However, this does not definitively close the Ferrari engineer spy case.</seg>
<seg id="5"> The Motor Sports Council also said in this decision: "If it is found in the future that the information relating to Ferrari has been used to the detriment of the championship, we reserve the right to request McLaren to return to WMSC for a hearing.  At that time, they may face the penalty of the cancellation of their qualification to take part in the 2007 championship and even the 2008 championship."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Mike Coughlan, the former chief designer for McLaren who has now been suspended from his job, has been found to have been in possession of nearly 800 pages of Ferrari's technical documents.  The contents included sets of details of the design, power, construction, checks, tests, development and operation of Ferrari's 2007 race car.</seg>
<seg id="7"> McLaren insists that no-one else in the team knew about this information before Coughlan was suspended from his job, and that the McLaren car for this season has no elements from Ferrari.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Experts Think Insurance QDIIs Will Not Divert Funds away from Domestic Stock Market in the Short Term</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Chinanews.com, July 30</seg>
<seg id="3"> According to a report in China Securities Journal, the Provisional Measure for the Overseas Investment with Insurance Funds was recently published, and insurance funding has greater room for operation in the capital markets.</seg>
<seg id="4"> China Life Insurance Company's chief investment officer Liu Lefei thinks that with the renminbi appreciation and the domestic capital markets improving, insurance institutions will not make large investments overseas through foreign currency purchases in the short term.  This also means that insurance QDIIs will not divert funds away from the domestic stock market in the short term.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The report says that quite a few insurance institutions hold the same view.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Experts say that because there is currently no renminbi derivatives market as yet, and the risk-avoidance techniques of insurance institutions are not sufficient, the time is not yet ripe for large-scale foreign currency purchases.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Liu Lefei says that in the long term, in terms of asset allocation, overseas investment should occupy a certain proportion of an insurance company's overall allocation.</seg>
<seg id="8"> However, given the fairly large upwards pressure on the renminbi at present, China Life would mainly be using its own funds in foreign currencies for making overseas investment.</seg>
<seg id="9"> In the current situation it should take a cautious attitude toward purchasing foreign currencies to invest overseas.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Reporters learned from the State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters that as of July 29, 118000000 mu of agricultural land had been hit by floods across the country; of these, 54140000 mu had been ruined; 119150000 people had been affected by natural disaster; 652 people had died in natural disasters; 452000 buildings had collapsed; and direct financial losses were 52500000000 yuan.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> On July 29, the State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters was urgently organizing to deal with the current serious flood control and drought relief situation.</seg>
<seg id="5"> It called on all provinces along the Huai River and the Huai River Flood Control Headquarters to strengthen their dispatch service, to enhance their maintenance of dikes during periods of receding water, and to strive for a complete victory in the Huai River flood prevention and control.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Chinanews.com, July 31  On the 30th Chen Shui-bian questioned that members of the judiciary on the island may have tried to get involved in elections for leaders in the Taiwan region.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Kao Chin-chih, director-general of Taiwan's "Department of Judicial Administration," said on the same day that the current behavior of judges on the island was not as Chen Shui-bian said, and demanded that Chen Shui-bian give an explanation of his comments.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> According to reports in Taiwan's United Daily, Chen Shui-bian questioned on the 30th that for political reasons or electoral considerations, judges, prosecutors or investigators may be interfering with, affecting or even trying to control the campaign activities of candidates from all parties.  He said he hoped that this kind of phenomenon did not exist in Taiwan, but that it was perhaps extremely difficult.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Weng Yueh-sheng, "president of the Judicial Yuan" in Taiwan, kept quiet and made no response to Chen Shui-bian's questions, but "Secretary-General" Fan Kuang-chun sent Kao Chin-chih to make a statement on behalf of the "Judicial Yuan."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Kao Chin-chih said that Taiwan's basic law and the "regulations for judges" both explicitly state that judges should be above party factions, must not take part in political party activities, and must not campaign, either.  Judges were all extremely prudent and respected these relevant restrictions, and the "Judicial Yuan" believed that judges all acquit themselves admirably.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Kao Chin-chih gave an example, saying that "High Court Kaohsiung Branch Court" judge Chang Sheng-hsi took part in a class at the Ketagalan Institute a few years ago, the self-regulation council organized by judges decided to punish him because the relevant syllabus had political party implications.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Once Chang Sheng-hsi wanted to take part in the DPP primaries, but because of controversy over retaining his position and taking part in the election, he decided in the end to give up on it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Kao Chin-chih believes that if it's specific judgments in cases, there is relief available at the court level, and one should not infer that judges have political intentions simply based on wins or losses in the verdicts.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Don't Blindly Worship Legal "Theory Circle"</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> It is stipulated in Article 8 of the draft amendment of the Lawyers Law which has been recently submitted to the NPC standing committee for review that people who were once engaged in the profession of researching and teaching laws and have obtained advanced professional titles or equivalent professional levels may be granted the permission to practice law when their applications for lawyers' licenses pass the review by the judicial administrative department of the State Council.</seg>
<seg id="3"> (June 28, the China Youth Daily)</seg>
<seg id="4"> In the legal community there is a distinction between the "theory circle" and the "practice circle."  The former mainly includes the "abstract activities" such as teaching and researching laws, while the latter is more engaged in the "concrete activities" such as litigation, legal counseling, and legal services.</seg>
<seg id="5"> For a long time there has existed a phenomenon of "scholars' mutual contempt" between the legal "theory circle" and the "practice circle."  The "theory circle" believes that the "practice circle" lacks the necessary legal training and consists only of mechanical "legalists," while the "practice circle" criticizes the "theory circle" by pointing out that "theory cannot direct practice."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> With regard to such a labor division, what the law can do is to maintain neutrality rather than vigorously support either party.</seg>
<seg id="7"> However, the "system of specially licensed lawyers" in the Lawyers Law acknowledges in reality the judgment that the legal "theory circle" is superior to the legal "practice circle."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> In fact, some experts and scholars who have been engaged in the research and teaching of pure legal theories such as the history of the legal system and the international laws have nothing to do with practicing law no matter how profound their theoretical achievements have been.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Thus, the "system of specially licensed lawyers" has doubtlessly opened up a "bad loophole" for confusing qualification in the legal "practice circle" which will have an extremely negative impact.</seg>
<seg id="10"> There is also more blind worship of the "theory circle" than these.  For example, the phenomenon that expert opinions and expert panels frequently influence and even negate court rulings is also a direct manifestation of such blind worship.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Keep Public Places from Harassment of Peddlers</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> When people go out traveling, they are looking for relaxation, freshness, and freedom, enjoying as much as possible the natural scenery and achievements of civilized society.</seg>
<seg id="3"> However, while traveling in the country, many people have experienced such nuisance as being besieged and cornered by peddlers and middlemen in public places.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Whether you are getting on or off a bus or train, you invariably suffer the harassment of peddlers and some unlicensed middlemen.</seg>
<seg id="5"> They either sell chicken eggs, peanuts, or sesame seed cakes, or newspapers and magazines.  In addition, many unlicensed middlemen make referrals to restaurants and lodgings, even hawking fake certificates, fake receipts, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="6"> If you don't take them, he can chase you for several hundreds of meters as if he would rather die than fail.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> In some scenic spots, many tourists also have the same experience.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Before you enter the main gate, someone would come to hawk things like tourist souvenirs and small pieces of arts and crafts.</seg>
<seg id="9"> There are more scenarios of this kind after you go through the gate, which completely ruins even your best mood.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Some media once reported that many foreign tourists coming to Xi'an praised endlessly the places of historic interest and scenic beauty in Xi'an, but felt it was incomprehensible that crowds of peddlers are allowed to hawk their wares everywhere.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Such public places including bus stations and scenic spots are places meant for traveling and recreation.  Attention should be paid to civility and orderliness as well as tranquility and harmony, providing tourists a comfortable and relaxing environment.</seg>
<seg id="12"> The unrestricted entry and exit of peddlers not only disturb the mood of tourists, but also actually destroy the public order of these public places, giving rise to the visual contamination and environmental contamination, while providing the conditions and opportunities for lawless people to make trouble.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The important thing is that these public places are the windows of spiritual civilization construction in the local areas.  A small glimpse can reveal a larger picture.  Not only the image is being damaged but the growth of local economy will also be impacted.</seg>
<seg id="14"> Just imagine, if you want to expand and strengthen the tourism industry but welcome guests traveling from all directions with such a messy tourist environment, who will still want to come, and who still dare to come?</seg>
<seg id="15"> Then how can your tourist economy gain returns?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> As the tourist high season approaches, creating a civilized tourist environment for tourists coming from all directions should be considered the top priority.</seg>
<seg id="17"> Public places are not markets.  The operation by peddlers should be regulated.  Unlicensed operation must be resolutely banned, and there should be relentless crackdown on illegal activities.</seg>
<seg id="18"> Only a civilized and orderly environment can get tourists to come happily, who will leave after fully enjoying themselves and keep the passion for a return trip.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> In a word, keep public places from the harassment of peddlers.</seg>

<seg id="1"> "Rewarding Voluntary Withdrawal from Welfare System" Does Not Hold Water</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The Jianguomen Neighborhood in Dongcheng District of Beijing gave away things like refrigerators as rewards to twelve households that voluntarily withdrew from the welfare system.</seg>
<seg id="3"> (The Beijing News, July 10)</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> While feeling happy for these families for the improvement of their lives, this writer is ambivalent toward the proposal of "voluntary withdrawal from the welfare system" and the "reward-giving" method.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The deputy director of the Jianguomen Neighborhood office said, "In response to the issue of the welfare fraud, encouraging voluntary withdrawal from the welfare system aims to set a good example for other households on welfare."</seg>
<seg id="6"> If it is to encourage other welfare recipients to get out of their difficult situations through their own efforts, then this example is indeed worth promoting.  If this is intended to "appeal" to those longtime cheaters of the welfare system, then it may be a bit naive.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Working to distinguish between real and fake welfare recipients and sort them out, we should rely more on the law.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The relevant department should stress the obligations that welfare recipients must carry out while enjoying the welfare: for example, promptly notifying the changes in the family members and incomes, reporting the status of employment, accepting regular reviews, etc.  On the other hand, the relevant department should step up monitoring and inspection.</seg>
<seg id="9"> After all, only "withdrawing from the welfare system according to the law" is the long-term strategy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Who will foot the bill for the material rewards given by the neighborhood to the households that withdrew from the welfare system?</seg>
<seg id="11"> As a level-one government organization, the neighborhood's expenses are covered by the funding from the government budget.</seg>
<seg id="12"> However, is it legitimate to spend this sum of tax payers' money?</seg>
<seg id="13"> On the one hand, households that have withdrawn from the welfare system prove that they have attained certain abilities to be "self-sufficient;" on the other hand, aren't there still people who apply for the welfare?</seg>
<seg id="14"> The funding from the government budget which is called "life-saving" money should be used to provide timely help instead of extra bonus.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Liu Gangyi's Remark about His Willingness to Be a Service Provider Is More Believable</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> On July 10, Liu Gangyi, the party committee secretary of Mulan Township, Xindu District, Chengdu City, who is the first township party committee secretary through public nomination and direct election in the whole country, received his fourth democratic evaluation since he took office.  The rate of satisfaction reached 97%.</seg>
<seg id="3"> During his conversation with reporters, Liu Gangyi defined himself as a "service provider."</seg>
<seg id="4"> (Yesterday, The Beijing News)</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The "service provider" as spoken by Liu Gangyi is probably more truthful and more believable than the "service provider" as spoken by some appointed cadres.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The greatest advantage of public nomination and direct election as compared with the system of appointment lies in the fact that in the former the source of power is mainly determined by ordinary party members and the masses, while in the latter it is mainly appointed by upper-level organizations.  And where the power originates determines that the former must take its  responsibility to the general public as top priority.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The source of power and to whom they should answer are the basic factors that determine how the elected will go about their work.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Some people suspect that this kind of "democratic evaluation" is more like a "democracy show."</seg>
<seg id="9"> My opinion is that it is better to have this form of "democratic evaluation" than nothing at all.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Considering the history and current status of China's grassroots democratic and political construction, I think that it is already a major breakthrough to have public nomination and direction election.  Being a major component of this innovation, the democratic evaluation is not to be underestimated in promoting the grassroots democratic and political construction.</seg>

<seg id="1"> In Guangxi 135 Responsible Posts Have Been Inspected for Administrative Efficiency and 619 People Have Been Held to Account</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Over the course of the current year, all departments in all parts of Guangxi have launched a movement to transform cadres' style of work and strengthen the building of administrative efficiency in official bodies, implementing the "three systems:" the "ask first" responsibility system, the time-limited case-handling system and the accountability system.   Thirty-three key approval departments directly under the autonomous region and 135 responsible posts have been brought into the administrative efficiency inspection work network.</seg>
<seg id="3"> So far, 619 people have been held to account.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> On the 5th this reporter learned from the Commission for Discipline Inspection of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region that Guangxi has currently formed a rudimentary administrative efficiency inspection work network at the autonomous region, municipality and county levels.  They are strengthening inspection of key departments and responsible posts, and the electronic inspection systems of 14 municipalities have been completely linked with that of the autonomous region.</seg>
<seg id="5"> The autonomous region's electronic system for the inspection of administrative efficiency is directly connected to 33 key approval departments directly under the autonomous region and 135 responsible posts that deal with the investment environment and the production and life of the masses,  further standardizing their approval behavior and raising their approval efficiency.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> At the same time, all levels of Guangxi's discipline inspection supervision bodies are solemnly investigating cases that touch on the efficiency of workstyles or harm the interests of the people.  So far, they have investigated and verified 1104 cases and concluded 769 cases, and held to account 584 work units and 619 individuals.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The secretary of the standing committee of Guangxi Autonomous Region's party committee and discipline inspection committee, Ma Tieshan, said on the 5th that inspection of administrative efficiency is a task that will accompany administrative activities from beginning to end, and it was necessary to gradually put in place a long-term and effective mechanism.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Guangxi is to further perfect and standardize all of its administrative management regulations and systems, and set up and perfect an administrative efficiency inspection work mechanism and safeguard system, so as to put efficiency inspection on an institutionalized  and standardized track; further standandize supervision and inspection procedures, strengthen and improve the complaint resolution mechanism and performance evaluation and assessment mechanism; step up accountability, and use a strict accountability system to ensure the practical implementation of the "ask first" responsibility system, the time-limited case-handling system, and other work systems.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Staff Writer,  Beijing, July 13  Report by Yang Baojin and Correspondent Liu Xinxin: The whole of the army will change into 07-series military uniforms in succession from August 1.</seg>
<seg id="3"> This evening, China Military Online has specially invited Chen Jun, the deputy director of the Clothing and Equipment Office of the Military Supplies and Fuel Division of the General Logistics Department, and Su Yang, senior engineer in the Military Supplies Equipment Research Office of the General Logistics Department and one of the designers of the 07-series military uniforms, to be its guests at China Military Online, and engage in free discussions with netizens both in and outside the army on the background to the development of the new military uniforms and the manufacturing process, provoking a response from the netizens.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The two honored guests directly took part in the design and manufacture of the 07-series military uniforms.</seg>
<seg id="5"> While discussing the changes in the new uniforms, they explained that the 07-series uniforms were designed on the basis of previous uniform changes, in particular, the 97-series uniforms, and had made improvements in seven areas, including the uniform series, standards, and styles, totaling hundreds of items.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The greatest feature of the 07-series uniforms is that it has reflected the requirements for serialization, functionalization and personalization, allowing our army's military uniform to achieve standards in terms of coordination among the three armed services, completeness of varieties and the way the series forms a set for the first time.  This signifies the realization of a historical leap in the level of our army's military uniform development.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The two honored guests also carried out wide-ranging exchanges with the netizens on issues such as the new uniforms' types, styles, specifications, and accessories.</seg>

<seg id="1"> When You Start Well, You Still Need to Finish Well</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Judging simply from the result of the match, 2-2 seems a reasonable score, and is also one that the Chinese team can accept.  The key problem is that the way the match went made people feel it was rather a pity.</seg>
<seg id="3"> If the Iranian team had taken a 2-0 lead, then the Chinese team had evened up the score, then the feeling that would have given China's sports fans would certainly have been different.  It would have boosted morale.  The pity was that the situation was precisely the opposite.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> You could say that starting well but being unable to finish well is an old problem of the Chinese team.</seg>
<seg id="5"> The Chinese team often don't kick the ball when they have an excellent chance, and most people's view is that the psychological quality of China's players is not really up to it.</seg>
<seg id="6"> This is actually one reason why the Chinese team cannot "finish well."</seg>
<seg id="7"> However, judging by the Chinese team's match today, it may not be quite so.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Even if we set aside the fact that Sun Jihai, Sun Xiang, Shao Jiayi, Zheng Zhi and others have played in Europe, Li Weifeng and others are also old-timers with long experience of the battlefield.  They have experience and knowledge, and so it would be reasonable to say that there should not be any problem with their psychological quality.</seg>
<seg id="9"> The reason why the Chinese team was regrettably forced to a draw by the Iranian team this time may be because they deployed their forces in a lackadaisical manner at key points of the match.</seg>
<seg id="10"> When the Iranian team were behind, they substituted two persons, and the scene immediately seemed different.</seg>
<seg id="11"> In the second half, the Chinese team also substituted three players, but without a positive effect.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> To overcome the problem of starting well but being unable to finish well, it is definitely necessary to pinpoint the source of the problem.</seg>
<seg id="13"> As long as the problem is correctly grasped, it will probably not be difficult to find a way to get rid of the problem.</seg>
<seg id="14"> The worst thing when you have a serious illness is just to go to see any doctor.</seg>
<seg id="15"> If they carry on like this, no matter how many matches the Chinese team play, the old problem will still continue, and the constant progress with every game that everyone expects will be out of the question.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, London,  July 2  Icelandic scientists have discovered through research that the risk of arrhythmia among people with two types of genetic variation in their bodies is far greater than among ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="3"> According to a report in the latest issue of Nature magazine, after researchers at Iceland's deCode Genetics Inc sifted through the genes of thousands of people from Iceland, Sweden, and the US, as well as China's Hong Kong region, they made the above-mentioned discovery.</seg>
<seg id="4"> The two genes discovered by the scientists are located close to a gene that plays an important role in the early growth of the heart.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Arrhythmia, namely atrial fibrillation, is one of the most common clinically observed irregularities of the rhythm of the heart, and can lead to heart palpitations, shortness of breath, tiredness as well as apoplectic fits.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Maracaibo (Venezuela) July 3 (Correspondent Liu Jian)</seg>
<seg id="3"> According to a report in the Venezuelan media on the 3rd, the US team's 37-year-old veteran goalkeeper, Keller, said during an interview here that if he could not find a suitable club to serve in after the America's Cup, then he would opt to retire.</seg>
<seg id="4"> "If I have not been able to get a contract for 1-2 seasons with a high-quality league team within four to six weeks of the conclusion of the America's Cup, then maybe retiring will not be a bad choice for me."</seg>
<seg id="5"> With the relegation of the Möchengladbach team to the 2nd Bundesliga, Keller also left this soccer team in which he had served for more than two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Although Keller has a mind to retire, he has many opportunities and clearly need not worry about finding a place.  He himself has frankly stated that there are currently as many as eight soccer teams that are interested in inviting him to join them.</seg>
<seg id="7"> However, this veteran goalkeeper who has served in league matches for the Spanish Primera Liga, the English Premiership, and the German Bundesliga, said that what he ultimately chooses to do will be decided by his family.  "My kid is already 9 years old.  He has followed me around and stayed in three different countries, and has been to three different schools, and so I need to consider in my current choice what would be better for my family."</seg>
<seg id="8"> In the Gold Cup competition that was concluded not long ago, Keller put in an outstanding performance, helping the US team to win the title.</seg>
<seg id="9"> In the current America's cup, he has, just as before, been given an important job to do by head coach Bradley, but he clearly cannot win the match singlehanded.  The US team, made up of "young guards," is no match for such strong South American opponents as Argentina and Paraguay, and during these two matches the goal he guarded was breached seven times.</seg>
<seg id="10"> The next match against Colombia will probably be the US team's and Keller's last performance in this America's Cup competition.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The three-day high-level military talks between the two Koreas, South Korea and North Korea, ended on bad terms today, as a result of each side sticking to its own views regarding marking the sea border.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The talks, held in the border city of Panmunjom, today entered the last day on the agenda.  North Korea's chief delegate Lieutenant General Kim Yong-chol (transliterated) said, "We concluded that we no longer need these fruitless talks."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Kim Yong-chol, obviously displeased with a flushed face, attacked South Korea for deliberately avoiding the discussion of drawing a new sea border to replace the existing "Northern Limit Line."</seg>
<seg id="5"> He pointed out that the "Northern Limit Line" is not legitimate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Located in the Yellow Sea, the "Northern Limit Line" was drawn by the US military in 1953 when the Korean War ended.  However, it has become a focus of dispute between the two Koreas in recent years, with North Korea even unwilling to recognize it.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> US Treasury Secretary Paulson arrived in China yesterday for a visit.  The US is currently making full efforts to convince China to further implement necessary economic reforms and environmental protection work, in particular the Renminbi exchange rate issue that has received a lot of attention.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> A US diplomat said that Paulson first went to visit Xining city, capital of Qinghai, a large province in northwest China.</seg>
<seg id="4"> China is currently implementing a series of environmental protection programs near the largest salt-water lake in Qinghai.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Paulson moved on to Beijing today, discussing with Chinese leading officials such topics as advancing the course of the "US-China Strategic Economic Dialogue" launched last year.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The "US-China Strategic Economic Dialogue" mainly discusses topics such as the economy and environmental protection, though most important is the Renminbi exchange rate issue.  US congressional representatives think that the Renminbi is excessively undervalued.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The US-China trade deficit is currently seeing a rapid, sharp increase.  Pressure in the US is gradually increasing, with congressional representatives ready to take retaliatory action to oppose their so-called unfair trade policies of China.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Last week, the US Senate Finance Committee passed a motion by an overwhelming vote requesting the Treasury Department to identify a list of countries whose exchange rate is in "fundamental misalignment," opening the door to potentially imposing economic sanctions against Beijing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> US congressional representatives say that the undervalued Renminbi makes goods sold from China to the US very cheap, aggravating the US-China trade imbalance.  The US trade deficit with China last year reached US $ 232500000000.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> A special hearing called by the FIA World Motor Sport Council for the Ferrari technology spy case came to a close in Paris yesterday evening, Beijing time.  The McLaren team that had been summoned escaped suffering: the council decided not to penalize McLaren for the time being.</seg>
<seg id="3"> After the hearing, the official FIA website issued a statement saying, "The Vodafone McLaren Mercedes team was in possession of confidential Ferrari information, but there is currently insufficient evidence to prove that this information was improperly used for the FIA Formula One World Championship.  We'll therefore impose no penalty."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> However, the Ferrari technology spy case does not end with this.</seg>
<seg id="5"> In this decision, the World Motor Sport Council also said, "If it is found in the future that relevant Ferrari information has been used to the detriment of the championship, we reserve the right to call McLaren back to a World Motor Sport Council hearing, where they could face punishment of disqualification from not only the 2007 season, but also the 2008 season."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Former McLaren chief designer Mike Coughlan, who is now suspended, was found with almost 800 pages of Ferrari technology documents containing a series of links to Ferrari's 2007 race cars, including design, power, construction, inspection, testing, development, and operation.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Chinanews.com, July 30</seg>
<seg id="3"> According to a China Securities Journal report, with the introduction of the Provisional Measures for Administration of Outbound Investment of Insurance Funds a few days ago, insurance funds have more space to utilize the capital markets.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Liu Lefei, chief investment officer of China Life Insurance Co. Ltd., believes that with Renminbi appreciation and positive trends in domestic capital markets, insurance institutions in the near future will not make large-scale overseas investments with foreign exchange purchases.  This also indicates that QDII insurers will not divert domestic stock market capital in the near future.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The report said that many insurance institutions share the same view.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Experts believe that as there is currently no market for Renminbi derivatives, insurance institutions have insufficient means of avoiding risk.  As a result, it is not time yet for large-scale foreign exchange purchases.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Liu Lefei said that in terms of capital allocation, outbound investment should make up a certain ratio of overall allocations for insurance companies in the long run.</seg>
<seg id="8"> However, in view of relatively strong pressure for Renminbi appreciation at present, China Life will mainly use its own foreign exchange funds for outbound investments.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Foreign exchange purchases for outbound investment should be handled carefully under the current situation.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Chinanews.com, July 31 - On the 30th, Chen Shuibian questioned an attempt by the island's judicial personnel to interfere with the election of the Taiwan region's leaders.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Taiwan's "Department of Judicial Administration Director-General" Kao Chin-chih said on the same day that the current performance of the island's judges does not match what Chen Shuibian said, and requested that Chen Shuibian explain what he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> According to a report from Taiwan's United Daily News, on the 30th Chen Shuibian questioned interference, influence, and even attempts to control the election activities of the various parties' candidates, due to political factors or election considerations, by judges, public prosecutors, or investigators.  He claimed he hopes that this phenomenon does not exist in Taiwan, but that it might be very difficult.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> In response to Chen Shuibian's questioning, Taiwanese "Judicial Yuan President" Weng Yueh-sheng kept a low profile and did not respond.  "Secretary-General" Fan Kuang-chun, on the other hand, assigned Kao Chin-chih to speak on behalf of the "Judicial Yuan."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Kao Chin-chih said that both the Taiwanese constitution and the "Judges' Rules" proclaim in writing that judges must be nonpartisan, cannot participate in political party activities, and cannot assist in elections; judges abide by the relevant restrictions very carefully.  The "Judicial Yuan" believes the judges are all doing a good job.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Kao Chin-chih gave an example, noting that Judge Jang Shenq-shii of Kaohsiung "Branch High Court" participated a few years ago in a course conducted by the Ketagalan School, and was punished because the course was tainted by a political party.  The punishment resolution was by a self-disciplinary committee composed of judges.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Jang Shenq-shii once wanted to take part in DPP primary elections, and eventually decided to give up because there was controversy over his election participation while working.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Kao Chin-chih thinks that if the ruling of an individual case can be appealed to a higher court for relief, it cannot be inferred that a judge has political motives based only on whether the ruling is a win or a loss.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Don't Believe Blindly in the "Theoretical Field" of Law</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Clause 8 of the revised draft of the Law on Lawyers, which was recently submitted to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress for review, states: Those who have undertaken specialized work such as legal research or teaching and had a high-level title or the equivalent, upon application to become a lawyer can be allowed to practice law after examination and verification by the State Council's judicial administrative department.</seg>
<seg id="3"> (June 28, China Youth Daily)</seg>
<seg id="4"> In law, there is the "theoretical field" and the "practical field."  The former mainly includes "abstract actions" such as legal teaching and research work, while the latter undertakes more "concrete actions" such as litigation, legal consultation, and legal services.</seg>
<seg id="5"> For a long time, "intellectual disparagement" has existed between the "theoretical field" and "practical field" of law.  The "theoretical field" thinks that the "practical field" lacks necessary accomplishment in the law and are only mechanical "legalists"; meanwhile, the response of the "practical field" to criticism by the "theoretical field" is "theory cannot guide practice."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Concerning this kind of division of labor gap, what the law can do is stay neutral instead of giving strong support to either side.</seg>
<seg id="7"> However, the "specially licensed lawyer system" in the Law on Lawyers objectively recognizes a judgment that the law's "theoretical field" is above the law's "practical field."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The fact is that some experts and scholars who are engaged in researching and teaching of pure legal theory, such as history of the legal system and international law, do not fit with practical law regardless of their depth of theoretical attainment.</seg>
<seg id="9"> In this way, for the law's "practical field," the "specially licensed lawyer system" no doubt opens a "bad door" which very negatively influences chaos in qualifications.</seg>
<seg id="10"> This is not the only blind belief about the "theoretical field."  The phenomenon of expert opinions and expert panel discussions frequently influencing and even overruling court rulings is another direct manifestation of this kind of blind belief.</seg>

<seg id="3"> However, many people encounter this kind of vexation when traveling domestically: being chased and intercepted by peddlers and middlemen in public places.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Whether on autos or trains, boarding or alighting, there are constant entanglements with small peddlers and some unlicensed middlemen.</seg>
<seg id="5"> If they are not selling eggs, peanuts, or sesame seed cakes, they are selling newspapers and magazines.  There are also many unlicensed middlemen introducing restaurants and hotels, even peddling fake certificates and fake receipts, among other things.</seg>
<seg id="6"> If you do not accept, he can chase you for a few hundred meters, like someone ready to die for a just cause in the face of failure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> At some scenic spots, many tourists also have the same feeling.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Prior to entering the main gate, people come to peddle things like travel souvenirs and small crafts.</seg>
<seg id="9"> After entering, there is more of this kind of situation.  No matter how good your mood, you will be bothered to the point of losing interest.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Media have reported that many foreign tourists in Xi'an sing endless praise for the scenic spots and historic sites of Xi'an, but cannot understand why masses of small peddlers and hawkers are allowed to sell everywhere.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Public places including bus stations and scenic spots are at root places for trips and relaxation.  They should be civilized, orderly, quiet, harmonious, providing tourists a comfortable and relaxed environment.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Peddlers' freedom to come and go not only affects the mood of tourists, it also destroys the public order of these public places on an objective level, bringing about visual pollution and environmental pollution.  At the same time, it also gives lawless people the condition and opportunity for creating trouble.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The Jianguomen neighborhood in Dongcheng District, Beijing, gave items such as refrigerators as a reward to 12 poor families who exited from subsistence allowances on their own initiative.</seg>
<seg id="3"> (Beijing News, July 10)</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> This writer feels happy for the improved lives of these families, but has mixed feelings about the phrase "self-initiated exit from subsistence allowances," and the practice of "giving rewards."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> An assistant director of the Jianguomen neighborhood said, "In light of problems like cheating on subsistence allowances, encouraging the self-initiated exit from subsistence allowances sets an example for other poor families."</seg>
<seg id="6"> This example is indeed worth promoting if it encourages other poor people to get out of their predicaments through one's own hard work; it is really somewhat naïve if it is thought this will "inspire" those people who have fraudulently received subsistence allowances for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="7"> When differentiating and straightening out real and fake poor families, what should be relied on more is the law.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Relevant departments should strengthen the obligations that must be met for poor families to enjoy subsistence allowances: such as immediately reporting changes in family members' incomes, reporting employment situation, and accepting regular reviews.  Meanwhile, relevant departments should increase the strength of supervision and investigation.</seg>
<seg id="9"> In the end, "exit from subsistence allowance according to the law" is the long-term solution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Who pays when the neighborhood gives material rewards to families who exit from subsistence allowance?</seg>
<seg id="11"> As a first-level governmental organization, a neighborhood has its expenses covered by financial allocations.</seg>
<seg id="12"> However, should this taxpayer money be spent?</seg>
<seg id="13"> On the one hand, families who exit from subsistence allowances prove that they already have a certain "self-sufficient" capacity; on the other hand, aren't there still people who are applying for subsistence allowances?</seg>
<seg id="14"> Government financial allocations, which is called a lifeline, should provide timely help rather than reward good fortune.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> "Service provider" in the words of Liu Gangyi may be more real, more convincing than "service provider" in the words of some appointed cadres.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The biggest advantage of being directly elected by the public compared to appointment is that for the former, determination of power mainly originates with ordinary party members and the public, whereas for the latter, nominations are mainly by superior organizations.  Therefore, direction of the power source determines that with the former, responsibility to the public must be given top priority.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The source of power, and to whom one owes responsibility, are basic elements that determine how elected people carry out their work.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Some people question whether such "democratic review" is more like a "democracy show."</seg>
<seg id="9"> My opinion is, having this kind of "democratic review" format is better than nothing.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Considering the history and current situation of China's grassroots democratic political development, I think direct election by the public is already a major breakthrough.

<seg id="6"> Since the Congress Party has an advantage in the presidential electoral college, the media and public largely guess that the possibility of a Patil victory is higher.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Patil, who is 72 years old this year, was Rajasthan's female governor.</seg>
<seg id="8"> She started out as a lawyer, entering parliament in 1985.  With abundant political work experience, she received high opinions from the government when governor of Rajasthan.</seg>
<seg id="9"> She has also dedicated herself for social welfare, as honorary chairwoman for many cultural, educational, and social welfare organizations.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Analysts note that Patil became a candidate as a result of her unswerving loyalty to Sonia Ghandi, president of India's Congress Party.</seg>
<seg id="11"> In India, the Ghandi family has been controlling the governing Congress Party for a long time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Patil has received many female voters' support.  Female voters believe that in India where there is a strong concept of discrimination against women, Patil will remold the image of women and raise the status of women.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The constitution stipulates that the president of India, a federal country, is the country's leader and commander-in-chief of the armed forces in name, without representing any party or organization.  It is more of a symbol.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> From this year, every department in each region of Guangxi has launched a campaign to change the working style of cadres and intensify construction of administrative efficiency in its organizations.  It implements "three systems:" the initial enquiry responsibility system, the handling formalities within time limits system, and the responsibility accountability system.  The key examination and approval departments affiliated to 33 autonomous regions and 135 positions of responsibility were brought into the administrative efficiency supervision work network.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Up until now, 619 people have been called to account.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> On the 5th, this correspondent learned from the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Committee for Discipline Inspection that at present Guangxi has preliminarily formed a three tier, autonomous region, municipal and county administrative efficiency inspection work network to intensify supervision of the key departments and positions of responsibility.  An electronic monitoring system of 14 cities has been fully implemented in the autonomous region's network.</seg>
<seg id="5"> The autonomous region administrative efficiency electronic inspection system connects directly to the key examination and approval departments affiliated to 33 autonomous regions and 135 positions of responsibility that deal with the investment environment and the life and work of the people.  This has further standardized the conducting of examinations and approvals, as well as improved its efficiency.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> At the same time, all levels of discipline inspection and monitoring organizations in Guangxi are strictly investigating and dealing with cases involving work style and efficiency, and damage to the public interest.  Up until now, a total of 1104 cases have been verified and investigation results for 769 cases have been finalized; 584 work units and 619 people have been called to account.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Member of the standing committee of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Party Committee and Discipline Inspection Committee Secretary Ma Tieshan said on the 5th that administrative efficiency inspection is an item of work that will always remain concomitant with administrative activities and must be progressively formed into a longstanding and effective mechanism.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Guangxi must further perfect and standardize codes of practice for each item of administrative management, build a complete administrative efficiency monitoring work system and safeguarding mechanism, and bring efficiency monitoring on track of systemization and standardization.  It must further regulate monitoring and inspection procedures, build a complete complaint handling and performance efficiency evaluation and assessment mechanism, and significantly increase accountability efforts by using a strict accountability system to ensure that the initial enquiry responsibility system, the handling formalities within time limits system and other work systems are put fully into practice.</seg>

<seg id="2"> Staff Report, Beijing, July 13 - Report by Yang Baojin and Correspondent Liu Xinxin: Starting on August 1, every army in the entire armed forces will successively change to wearing the 07 style uniform.</seg>
<seg id="3"> This evening, the pladaily.com specially invited Chen Jun, deputy director of the Army General Logistics Military Supplies and Fuels Department Clothing and Equipment Office, and Su Yang, senior engineer at the Army General Logistics Department Military Supplies Equipment Research Institute and one of the designers of the 07 style uniform, to visit pladaily.com and chat with net friends inside and outside the army about the background, research and development process behind the birth of the new uniform, drumming up a response among netizens.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Two honored guests were directly involved in the design, research and development of the 07 style uniform.</seg>
<seg id="5"> When speaking of changes to the new uniform, they introduced by saying that the 07 style uniform was designed based on all previous uniform design changes, especially the 97 style uniform, and that as many as several hundred improvements were made in seven areas, including army uniform series, manufacture, style and so on.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The biggest feature of the 07 style uniform is that it embodies the requirements of serialization, functionality and humanization, making our army's uniform achieve, for the first time, a standard for the three armies that is coordinated, has a complete variety, and whose series match.

<seg id="1"> If You Start Well, You Should Finish Well</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Simply speaking from the match result, a 2-2 score is reasonable and is also acceptable to the Chinese team.  The key is that the match itself left people feeling somewhat disappointed.</seg>
<seg id="3"> If Iran was in the lead 2-0 and then China came back to even the score, the impression given to Chinese fans would definitely be different and morale would have lifted a lot.  What a pity that the situation was exactly the opposite.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> One could say that starting well and being unable to finish well is an old problem for the Chinese team.</seg>
<seg id="5"> The Chinese team often plays poor soccer when their situation is extremely favorable, and the view of the average person is that the Chinese players are mentally not strong enough.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Indeed, this is one of the reasons China is incapable of "finishing well."</seg>
<seg id="7"> However, looking at China's match tonight, this does not necessarily seem to be the case.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Not mentioning Sun Jihai, Sun Xiang, Shao Jiayi, Zhen Zhi and others who played soccer in Europe before, Li Weifeng and others are also old war veterans.  They have extensive experience and, logically speaking, should not have any problems pschologically.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Regretfully, this Chinese team was held to a draw by Iran, and I am afraid that the reason was ineffective deployment of troops in the course of a battle.</seg>
<seg id="10"> While lagging behind, Iran substituted two people, and the scene immediately improved.</seg>
<seg id="11"> China also substituted three players in the second half, but the result was not good.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> To overcome the old problem of starting well and being unable to finish well, they must correctly determine the source of the problem.</seg>
<seg id="13"> As long as the problem can be correctly determined, it should not be hard to find a way to remove the problem.</seg>
<seg id="14"> What they really should fear is acting blindly out of desperation.</seg>
<seg id="15"> If they continue this way, no matter how many matches the Chinese team play, they will continue to repeat their old problem.  This is a far cry from everyone's expectation to see them improve with each match they play.</seg>

<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, London, July 2 - Icelandic scientists discovered through research that people with mutation in two types of gene in the body have a far greater risk of getting afflicted with atrial fibrillation than the average person.</seg>
<seg id="3"> According to a report in the latest issue of Nature magazine, after screening the genes of several thousand people from Iceland, Sweden, the US, and the Hong Kong region of China, researchers at Iceland's deCODE Genetics Company made the above discovery.</seg>
<seg id="4"> These two types of gene discovered by scientists are located near that of a type of gene that plays an important role in the early stages of heart development.</seg>
<seg id="5"> AF, i.e. atrial fibrillation, is clinically one of the most commonly seen cardiac arrhythmias and can give rise to heart palpitations, shortness of breath, tiredness and sudden stroke.</seg>
<seg id="6"> In addition, according to a report in Nature Genetics magazine published on the 1st, researchers at deCODE Genetics Company also discovered two types of gene on human chromosome 17 correlating to prostate cancer morbidity.

<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Maracaibo (Venezuela), July 3 (Correspondent Liu Jian)</seg>
<seg id="3"> According to a Venezuelan media report on the third, US team's 37-year-old veteran goalkeeper Keller said in an interview here that if he is unable to find a suitable club to serve after the America Cup, then he will choose retirement.</seg>
<seg id="4"> "If I am still unable to obtain a one to two season contract in a high level league team four to six weeks after the America Cup ends, then perhaps retirement is not a bad option for me."</seg>
<seg id="5"> With Munchen-Gladbach falling to the German Bundesliga 2, Keller also left this team which he served for more than two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Although Keller is considering turning in his gloves, he obviously has more than enough suitors who are interested in him.  He spoke candidly that at present, as many as eight teams are interested in inviting him to join them,</seg>
<seg id="7"> yet this veteran goalkeeping idol, who has served in the Spanish Primera League, the English Premier Division, and German Bundesliga 1, expressed that how he finally decides, depends upon his family, "My child is already 9 years old, he has stayed with me in three different countries and gone to three different schools.  My choice now must consider how to better benefit my family."</seg>
<seg id="8"> In the Gold Cup that ended not long ago, Keller performed outstandingly and helped the US team capture the championship.</seg>
<seg id="9"> In the current America Cup, he was still entrusted with the important task by head coach Bradley, but what can one man do against overwhelming odds; a US team of "Elite Young Guards" setting out to do battle is fundamentally no rival for such South American giants as Argentina and Paraguay.  In these two matches, the goal he guarded was penetrated 7 times.</seg>
<seg id="10"> The next match, paired up against Columbia, is very likely to be the US team's and Keller's final performance in the current America Cup.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The Institute for Science and International Security, a US-based think tank, today reported that commercial satellite imagery showed that Iran is tunneling at a mountain near the Natanz uranium enrichment facility, perhaps to protect nuclear equipments from an aerial attack.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> These images were taken by DigitalGlobe, a US-based company, on June 11 and released at the website of the Institute for Science and International Security.</seg>
<seg id="4"> The institute is a non-profit research organization located in Washington DC.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The images showed that road construction was underway going up a mountain 2.4 kilometers south of the Natanz facility whereas inside the facility was a uranium enrichment plant.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Analysts Albright and Brannan pointed out in a report that the entrances of the tunnel were not readily visible in the images. However, "one of the roads appears to lead into a tunnel facility. The other road may also lead to a tunnel entrance."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> They said, "Such a tunnel facility inside a mountain would offer excellent protection from an aerial attack."</seg>

<seg id="1"> Hoping to Break Deadlock on Doha Round of Talks, WTO Delegations Submit New Proposal</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Major mediators of the World Trade Organization today suggested the United States to largely reduce its agricultural subsidies and developing countries to make substantial tariff cuts in industrial products in order to break the deadlock on the Doha Round of trade talks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Officials said that the new 'draft model' requested the United States to reduce its annual agricultural subsidies from the currently permitted US $ 19000000000 to US $ 16200000000 and developing countries to cut their tariffs in industrial products to less than 23 percent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The proposals aimed at breaking the stalemate in the Doha Round of talks in the past six years and facilitating the 150 members of the World Trade Organization to reach a compromise.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Lamy, Director-General of the World Trade Organization, called the proposals "a fair and reasonable basis for reaching ambitious, balanced and development-oriented agreements".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Lamy said, "Members will not be fully satisfied with the texts. But what separates members today is smaller than what unites them."</seg>

<seg id="2"> Afghan Taliban had kidnapped 23 South Korean hostages. They demanded South Korea to withdraw their troops from Afghanistan and set the deadline at sunset today. Otherwise, they will kill the hostages.</seg>
<seg id="3"> With the time ticking, some positive progress had emerged in the situation. South Korean officials negotiated with the Taliban for the first time today.</seg>

<seg id="4"> However, at the same time, the Taliban claimed that another German hostage was extremely weak. He had begun to go into a coma and had lost consciousness.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The three-day top-level military talks between South and North Korea broke down today because each side persisted in its own position in the division of the maritime border.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The talks, held in the border city of Panmunjom, entered the last day of the agenda today. North Korean chief delegate Lieutenant Kim Yong Chol (transliteration) stated, "We've come to the conclusion that we don't need these fruitless talks any more."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> A red-faced and apparently angry Kim Yong Chol criticized South Korea for intentionally avoiding the discussion on drawing up a new maritime border to replace the original 'Northern Limit Line'.</seg>
<seg id="5"> He indicated that the Northern Limit Line is illegal.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The Northern Limit Line, located in the Yellow Sea, was drawn up by the U.S. army in 1953 at the end of the Korean War. However, it has become a bone of contention between the two Koreas and North Korea even refuses to recognize it.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="7"> North Korea stated that South Korean warships caused tensions by entering the maritime space illegally while South Korea claimed that the accusation was unfounded.</seg>

<seg id="1"> US Treasury Secretary Arrives in China to Visit, Environmental Protection and Exchange Rate As Key Concerns</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> U.S. Treasury Secretary Paulson arrived in China yesterday for a visit. The United States is exerting all efforts in convincing China to further implement necessary economic reforms and environmental protection work, particularly the Renminbi exchange rate topic that had attracted wide attention.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> U.S. diplomat stated that Paulson visited Xining City, the capital of major Chinese northwestern province Qinghai, earlier.</seg>
<seg id="4"> China is currently implementing a series of environmental protection plans near the largest salt-water lake in Qinghai Province.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Paulson traveled to Beijing today to discuss with chief Chinese officials on topics including the acceleration of the process of the 'US-China Strategic Economic Dialogue' initiated last year.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The US-China Strategic Economic Dialogue mainly discusses economic and environmental protection issues with Renminbi exchange rate being the most important one. U.S. congressmen argued that the value of Renminbi is underestimated.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The US-China trade deficit is soaring. Pressure inside the United States is increasing. Congressmen are preparing to adopt retaliatory measures to counter their so-called "unfair China trade policy".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Last week, the U.S. Senate Finance Committee overwhelmingly adopted a bill requiring the Treasury Department to identify list of nations with "fundamentally misaligned" currency exchange rate, thus opening a potential door to economic sanctions against Beijing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> U.S. congressmen said that an undervalued Renminbi makes goods exported from China to the United States very inexpensive, thus intensifying the US-China trade deficit. The US-China trade deficit had reached US $ 232500000000 last year.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> The special hearing held by the World Motor Sport Council for the Ferrari technology espionage case ended in Paris last night Beijing time. McLaren, the racing team being summoned, escaped misfortune: The council decided not to penalize McLaren racecar team for the time being.</seg>
<seg id="3"> The official website of the World Motor Sport Council published a declaration after the hearing that said, "Vodafone McLaren Mercedes was in possession of confidential Ferrari information. However, there is insufficient evidence that this information was used in such a way as to interfere improperly with the FIA Formula One World Championship. We therefore impose no penalty."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Nonetheless, the Ferrari technology espionage case did not end here.</seg>
<seg id="5"> The World Motor Sport Council also stated in the decision, ""But if it is found in the future that the Ferrari information has been used to the detriment of the championship, we reserve the right to invite Vodafone McLaren Mercedes back in front of the WMSC where it will face the possibility of exclusion from not only the 2007 championship but also the 2008 championship."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Mike Coughlan, former chief designer of McLaren who has now been terminated, was found to possess nearly 800 pages of Ferrari technical dossier containing a whole set of interconnections including the design, power, building, inspection, testing, development, and running of the 2007 Ferrari race cars.</seg>
<seg id="7"> McLaren insisted that before Coughlan was terminated, no one else in the racecar team had known about this information and that there is no Ferrari's elements in the racecars of McLaren this season.</seg>

<seg id="3"> According to report of China Securities, the Interim Administrative Measures for the Management of Offshore Investments of Insurance Funds was promulgated a few days ago. Insurance funds thus have wider room for utilization in the capital market.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Liu Lefei, Chief Investment Officer at China Life Insurance, believed that with the appreciation of the Renminbi and the strong domestic capital market, insurance institutions will not engage in large-scale offshore investments through foreign exchange purchase. This also implies that the Insurance QDII will not divert funds in domestic stock market in the near future.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The report stated that many insurance institutions shared the same view.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Expert stated that since a Renminbi derivative market still does not exist at the present moment, insurance institutions do not have adequate measures to avert risk. Therefore, conditions are not yet ripe for large-scale foreign exchange purchase.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Liu Lefei said that in the long run, in the area of asset allocation, offshore investments should make up a considerable portion in the overall allocation of insurance companies.</seg>
<seg id="8"> However, since the Renminbi has rather huge appreciation pressure at present, China Life Insurance will mainly utilize exchange funds that it has in offshore investments.</seg>

The afflicted population was 119150000, 652 people died from the disaster. The flood brought down 452000 houses and caused direct economic losses of 52500000000 yuan.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> On July 29, in view of the severe flood control and drought relief situation, the Office of State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters made emergency plans.</seg>
<seg id="5"> The office requested provinces along the Huaihe River and the Office of Huaihe River Flood Control Headquarters to enhance control and strengthen the guarding of embankments during flood stage to achieve overall victory in the flood control and flood fighting of the Huaihe River.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Chinanews.com, July 31 - Chen Shui-bian on the 30th raised doubts about attempts of judicial members in the island to intervene in the election of Taiwan regional leaders.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Kao Chin-chih, "Director-General of the Department of Judicial Administration" in Taiwan, stated on the same day that judges in the island are behaving differently from what Chen Shui-bian described and demanded an explanation from Chen Shui-bian for his remark.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> According to report of the United Daily News of Taiwan, Chen Shui-bian raised doubts about judges, prosecutors, and investigators intervened, influenced, and even attempted to control the election campaigns of various party candidates out of political factors or consideration for the elections. He claimed that he hoped this situation does not exist in Taiwan but it may be extremely difficult.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> In response to the doubt of Chen Shui-bian, Weng Yueh-sheng, "President of the Judicial Yuan" in Taiwan maintained a low-key and did not respond while "Secretary-General" Fan Kuang-chun appointed Kao Chin-chih to speak for the Judicial Yuan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Kao Chin-chih stated that the Fundamental Law of Taiwan and the "judges' rules and regulations" both proclaim in explicit terms that judges should transcend political parties and groups. They cannot participate in activities of political parties or assist in the campaign. Judges all follow relevant restraints cautiously. The Judicial Yuan believed that all judges have done well.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Kao Chin-chih quoted an example by saying that Chang Sheng-hsi, judge of the "Kaohsiung Branch of the Supreme Court", took part in the course offered by the Ketagalan Institute a few years ago. Since the related course had party flavor, the self-disciplinary committee formed by judges decided to take disciplinary action against him.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Chang Sheng-hsi once wanted to run in the primary election of the Democratic Progressive Party but due to the controversy over running in the election while in office, he finally decided to give up.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Kao Chin-chih argued that if it is for the trial of individual case, one can lodge an appeal to the court of higher instance. One cannot infer that judges have other political intentions solely based on the outcome of the verdict.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Don't Have Blind Faith in Legal "Theoretical Circle"</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Article 8 of the draft amendment of the Law on Lawyers recently submitted to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress for deliberation stipulates: people who have professional experiences in the research or teaching of law, with advanced professional titles or corresponding professional competence, may obtain a lawyer's license, and get approval from judicial departments under the State Council.</seg>
<seg id="3"> (June 28, China Youth Daily)</seg>
<seg id="4"> There is a difference between the "theoretical circle" and the "practical circle" in law. The former mainly includes "abstract behaviors" such as the teaching and research of law while the latter are more "concrete behaviors" such as engaging in litigations, legal consultations, and legal services.</seg>
<seg id="5"> The phenomenon of "scorning of each other" has long existed between the theoretical circle and the practical circle in law. The theoretical circle argues that the practical circle lacks necessary legal attainments and is simply mechanical "legalist" while the direction of criticism of the practical circle on the theoretical circle is that "theories cannot guide practice".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> In regards to such a divergence of division of labor, what law can do is to remain neutral instead of supporting any one side with mightiness.</seg>
<seg id="7"> However, the "chartered lawyer system" in the Law on Lawyers has objectively endorsed the judgment that the theoretical circle is superior to the practical circle in law.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> In fact, for some experts and scholars who engage in pure research and teaching of legal theories such as the history of legal system and international laws, no matter how thoroughly accomplished they are in theories, they will still be out of step with practical legal issues.</seg>
<seg id="9"> In this case, chartered lawyer system has no doubt set a "bad precedent" with extremely harmful effects on the qualification confusion in the practical circle in law.</seg>
<seg id="10"> The blind faith in the theoretical circle is not only limited to these. For instance, expert submissions and expert appraisal meetings always influence and even veto court verdicts. This phenomenon is also a direct manifestation of such blind faith.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> Travel is to seek relaxation, relief, comfort, and to enjoy natural scenery and results of social civilization to the fullest.</seg>
<seg id="3"> However, when traveling in China, many people encounter such an annoyance of being encircled, pursued, obstructed, and intercepted by peddlers and people engage in intermediary businesses in public places.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> When people getting on or off the vehicle, no matter car or train, they are always pestered by peddlers and some unlicensed middlemen.</seg>
<seg id="5"> If they are not selling eggs, peanuts, and sesame seed cakes, then they are selling newspapers and magazines, and then the many unlicensed middlemen recommending restaurants and hotels, and even selling fake documents and fake invoices so on and so forth.</seg>
<seg id="6"> If you turn him down, he can follow you for a few hundred meters and act very much like to win or die.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Many visitors also feel the same in some scenic spots.</seg>
<seg id="8"> People come to peddle things such as travel souvenirs and small handicrafts and things like that before one enters the door.</seg>
<seg id="9"> The situation increases once one enters the door. No matter how bright one's mood is, it will still be spoiled and one will feel insipid.</seg>
<seg id="10"> The media once reported that many foreign visitors to Xi'an spoke very highly of the scenic spots and historical sites of Xi'an. However, they could not understand why heaps of peddlers were allowed to peddle everywhere.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Public places such as stations and scenic spots are originally places where journey embarks or for leisure. Good manners and order, as well as peace and harmony should be stressed to provide visitors with a comfortable and relaxing environment.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Not only does the come and go at will of the peddlers disturb visitors' mood, objectively, they have disrupted the public order of these public places and caused visual and environmental pollution, and at the same time, it also provides conditions and opportunities to lawbreakers to incite trouble.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The important thing is that these public places are the windows of local spiritual civilization. Seen one and you have seen them all. What is being damaged is not only the issue of image, it also affects the economic development of the area.</seg>
<seg id="14"> Imagine, you want to make tourist industry a success but greet guests from all over with this dreadfully disordered tourist environment. Who still wants to come? Who still dares to come?</seg>
<seg id="15"> How can your tourist economy produce returns?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> With the arrival of peak travel season, top priority should be given to the creation of a civilized travel environment for visitors from all over.</seg>
<seg id="17"> Public places are not markets. The operating behaviors of peddlers should be regulated. Unlicensed operation should be adamantly abolished and illegal activities should be firmly suppressed.</seg>
<seg id="18"> Only a civilized and orderly environment will enable visitors to come gladly, to return after fully enjoying themselves, and to revisit with excitement.</seg>

<seg id="1"> "Reward for Voluntary Surrender of Low-Income Subsidy" Fails to Stand Close Scrutiny</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The Jianguomen neighborhood office in Dongcheng District, Beijing handed out items such as refrigerators as rewards for 12 low-income subsidy recipient families that voluntarily  surrendered their low-income subsidies.</seg>
<seg id="3"> (The Beijing News, July 10)</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The author is happy about the improvements in life of these families. However, I have mixed feelings about the wording of "voluntary surrender of low-income subsidy" and the practice of "giving out rewards".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Vice-chairman of Jianguomen neighborhood office said, "In order to address problems including defrauding low-income subsidy and so on, encouraging voluntary surrender of low-income subsidy is to set an example for other low-income subsidy recipient households."</seg>
<seg id="6"> If this example encourages other low-income subsidy recipients to turn the corner through efforts of their own, then it is indeed worth promoting. However, if one wants to use this to "inspire" people who have been defrauding low-income subsidy for a long time, then it is somewhat naive.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The work to differentiate and straighten up real and false low-income subsidy recipient households should rely more on the law.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Relevant departments should strengthen responsibilities that low-income subsidy recipient households need to fulfill when enjoying low-income subsidy: For example, inform changes in number of family members and income in a timely manner, report employment situation, and subjected to regular review. Meanwhile, relevant departments should step up efforts in supervision and inspection.</seg>
<seg id="9"> After all, only the "surrender of low-income subsidy according to the law" is the long-term plan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Who pays for the material rewards given to families that surrender their low-income subsidies by the neighborhood office?</seg>
<seg id="11"> As a level-one government agency, the expenses of the neighborhood office are shouldered by financial appropriation.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Then, should this sum of taxpayers' money be spent?</seg>
<seg id="13"> On the one hand, families that surrender their low-income subsidies have proven that they have certain abilities to be 'self-sufficient". On the other hand, aren't there still people who apply for low-income subsidy?</seg>
<seg id="14"> Government appropriation that is labeled as life-saving money should render timely help instead of making what is good still better.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Liu Gangyi's 'I Am Willing to Serve Others' Remark More Credible</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> On July 10, Liu Gangyi, the first Secretary of the township Party committee publicly nominated and directly elected in the country and the Secretary of the Party committee of Mulan Town in Xindu District, Chengdu City was subjected to democratic evaluation for the fourth time since he took office. He had an approval rating of 97 percent.</seg>
<seg id="3"> In the conversation between Liu Gangyi and the reporter, Liu Gangyi defined himself as "one who serves others".</seg>
<seg id="4"> (Yesterday, the Beijing News)</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The "one who serves others" that Liu Gangyi referred to is perhaps more truthful and convincing than "the one who serves others" referred to by some appointed cadres.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The biggest advantage of public nomination and direct election over appointment system is that it is mainly ordinary Party members and the people who determine the origin of the power of the former while the latter is mainly appointed by higher-level organizations, whereas the direction from which power originates has established that the former must give accountability to the people top priority.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The origin of power and to whom one is responsibleare fundamental factors in deciding how an electee conducts his work.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Some people challenge that such a "democratic evaluation" is more like a "democracy show".</seg>
<seg id="9"> My opinion is that having such form of democratic evaluation is better than not having any.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Given considerations to the history and current situation of the building of democratic politics at the grassroots level in China, I believe that direct public election is already a major breakthrough. Democratic evaluation is an important component of this unprecedented undertaking. It should not be underestimated in the advancement of building democratic politics at the grassroots level.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> On June 23, Patil put her palms together before filling out the presidential candidate documents.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The presidential election in India has begun on the 19th. The new president will emerge between the incumbent Vice President Shekawat and Pratibha Patil, the governor of Rajasthan who resigned not long ago.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Patil is the first female presidential candidate in India's history. If she is elected, she will become India's first woman president ever.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Patil is the presidential candidate of the ruling Congress Party while Shekawat is from the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Since the Congress Party has the upper hand in the presidential election, the media and the people all suspect that Patil has a relative high possibility of being elected.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Patil, 72, was the woman governor of Rajasthan.</seg>
<seg id="8"> She was a lawyer and joined the Congress in 1985. She is seasoned in politics. During her term as the governor of Rajasthan, she had received high opinions from the government.</seg>
<seg id="9"> She also devotes herself to social welfare and is the honorary chairman of many cultural, educational, and social welfare organizations.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Analysts pointed out that the reason Patil became the candidate was that she has pledged her allegiance steadfastly to Sonia Gandhi, the Chairman of the Congress Party.</seg>
<seg id="11"> In India, the Gandhi family has been controlling the ruling National Party for a long time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Patil has the support of many woman voters, who believe that Patil will rebuild the image of women and raise their status in India where the conception of discrimination against women is serious.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The Constitution stipulates that India is a federal state. The president is the ceremonial head of the state and the chief commander of the armed forces. He/she does not represent any party or organization and is more of a symbol.</seg>

<seg id="2"> This newspaper, Beijing, July 13, Reported by Yang Baojin, Reporter Liu Xinxin: All forces of the entire army will gradually change to wear the 07 style army uniforms starting August 1.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Tonight, the China Military Online specially invited Deputy Director Chen Jun of the Clothing and Equipment Office of Military Supply and POL Section of the General Logistics Department together with Su Yang, the senior engineer at the Quartermaster Equipment Institute of the General Logistics Department and one of the designers of the 07 style army uniforms, to serve as guests of the China Military Online to discuss the background of the emergence of the new army uniforms and their development process with netizens inside and outside the army. The discussion was well received by the netizens.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The two guests were direct participants of the design and development of the 07 style army uniforms.</seg>
<seg id="5"> In their discussion on the changes of the new army uniforms, they explained that the design of the 07 style army uniforms was based on all previous uniform changes, particularly the 97 style army uniforms. Several hundred refinements had been made to seven areas including the series, system, and style of the army uniforms.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The biggest characteristic of the 07 style army uniforms is that they have manifested the requirements for serialization, functionality, and humanity, thus enable our army uniforms to reach the standards of coordination of the three services, completeness of assortment, and variety of accessories for the first time.

<seg id="1"> Good Start Still Needs to See Things Through</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The 2-2 score was reasonable and was acceptable to the Chinese team if judging from the result of the game alone. The key was that the process of the game was somewhat regrettable.</seg>
<seg id="3"> If the Iranian team led by 2-0, then the Chinese team tied the score, that would definitely make Chinese fans feel very differently. It would bolster a lot of morale. Unfortunately, the situation was precisely the opposite.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Fails to see things through can be considered as an old problem of the Chinese team.</seg>
<seg id="5"> The Chinese team never knows how to play under excellent situation. The general opinion is that mentally Chinese players are not tough enough.</seg>
<seg id="6"> This is indeed a reason that the Chinese team fails to "see things through".</seg>
<seg id="7"> However, judging from the game that the Chinese team played today, it seems that it is not necessarily so.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Not only had Sun Jihai, Sun Xiang, Shao Jiayi, and Zheng Zhi played in Europe before, Li Weifeng and the others are also battle-hardened veterans. They are experienced and knowledgeable. Theoretically, there should not be any problem with their mental qualities.</seg>
<seg id="9"> This time, the Chinese team was regrettably pressed to tie with the Iranian team. The reason was probably the ineffectiveness in moving players on the field.</seg>
<seg id="10"> The Iranian team substituted two people while they were trailing behind and the situation was immediately improved.</seg>
<seg id="11"> The Chinese team also substituted three players in the second half but the outcome was not good.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> In order to overcome the problem of not seeing things through, one must find the root of the problem.</seg>
<seg id="13"> As long as one identifies the problem, means to resolve it is probably not hard to find.</seg>
<seg id="14"> The only worrisome thing is to try to find a cure indiscriminately for an emergency.</seg>
<seg id="15"> If the situation continues like this, no matter how many more games the Chinese team plays, it will still commit the same mistake. The continuous progress that people expect as it plays more games will be out of the question.</seg>

<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, London, July 2 - Icelandic scientists' research revealed that people who have two gene mutations in their bodies have a much higher risk of suffering from atrial fibrillation than normal people do.</seg>
<seg id="3"> According to report of the latest issue of the journal Nature, researchers of Iceland-based deCODE Genetics Inc. obtained the above finding after conducting screening of genes of several thousand people from Iceland, Sweden, the United States, and China's Hong Kong region.</seg>
<seg id="4"> The two genes discovered by the scientists are located close to a gene that plays an important role in early heart development.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Atrial fibrillation is the quivering of the heart. It is one of the most common types of clinical cardiac arrhythmia that can cause heart palpitations, shortness of breath, fatigue, and stroke.</seg>
<seg id="6"> In addition, according to report of the Nature Genetics journal published on the 1st, researchers of deCODE Genetics Inc. also identified two genes that link to prostate cancer on human chromosome 17. They play certain role in more than one third of prostate cancer cases.</seg>

<seg id="3"> According to report of Venezuelan media on the 3rd, during an interview here, the 37-year-old veteran goalkeeper of the U.S. team Keller stated that if he cannot find a suitable club to play for after the Copa America, then he will choose to retire.</seg>
<seg id="4"> "If four or six weeks after the Copa America ends I still can't strike a deal with a top level football team that would allow me to play another season or two then retirement may be a good choice."</seg>
<seg id="5"> With Moenchengladbach relegated to Germany's Second Division, Keller also left the team that he had played for for more than two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Even though Keller intends to retire, he, who is "yet to be married off", apparently is not worried about the next employer. He said frankly himself that currently, as many as eight clubs intend to invite him to join them.</seg>
<seg id="7"> However, the veteran goalkeeper, who had played in the Spain's First Division League, the English Premier League, and the Germany's First Division League, stated that his final decision rests on his family, "My child is nine years old already and he followed me to three different countries and studied in three different schools. My choice now must seek what's the best for my family."</seg>
<seg id="8"> In the Gold Cup Final that just ended recently, Keller had a stellar performance and helped the U.S. team won the championship.</seg>
<seg id="9"> In the Copa America this year, he was still entrusted with important task by head coach Bradley. However, one man alone cannot win. The U.S. team, which went to battle with "young guards", was simply no match for strong South American teams such as Argentina and Paraguay. The goal that he kept was penetrated seven times in two games.</seg>
<seg id="10"> The next game against the Colombian team will very probably be the last performance of the U.S. team and Keller in this year's Copa America.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Ankara, July 30 (Reporter Wang Jian) - The final result of the 23rd parliamentary election announced by Turkey's Supreme Election Commission on the 30th showed that the ruling Justice and Development Party won 341 out of the 550 seats and obtained the right to form a one-party Cabinet again.</seg>
<seg id="3"> In the parliamentary election held on July 22, the Republican People's Party, the main opposition party, won 112 seats.</seg>
<seg id="4"> The Nationalist Action Party won 77 seats in the election.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Besides the three parties aforementioned, 26 independents were also elected as congressmen.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The new session of the Turkish Parliament will hold its first meeting on August 4.</seg>
<seg id="7"> At that time, all members of Parliament will be sworn in and will begin to carry out their duties.</seg>
<seg id="8"> After that, the Parliament will elect the new House Speaker in form of secret ballots.</seg>
<seg id="9"> The parliamentary election in Turkey was originally scheduled to be held in November. However, since the Opposition Party boycotted Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Gul, the only candidate and a Justice and Development Party member, in the presidential election at the end of April, and led to the failure of the presidential election, the parliamentary election was thus held ahead of time.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Staff Writer, Berlin, July 1 (Correspondent Wang Huaicheng)</seg>
<seg id="3"> German Federal Minister of Education and Research Schavan said recently that Germany should lower the qualifying conditions for bringing in foreign professionals in the Immigration Law and solve the problem of the shortage of professionals that Germany is facing through increasing the recruitment of foreign talents.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> According to a report by OECD, by 2010 the number of workers between age 15 and 64 in Germany will be gradually decreasing each year.</seg>
<seg id="5"> If there are not enough immigrants, the labor force in Germany in 2020 will decrease by 6% as compared with the present.</seg>
<seg id="6"> However, reports by organizations such as the German Employers Association and the German Association of Engineers show that there is a relatively large shortage of engineers and professionals in the current job market in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="7"> According to the statistics from Germany's Federal Labor Department, this May, the supply of engineers in the labor market in Germany had a shortfall of about 12700 people and the supply of technicians had a shortfall of about 9600 people.</seg>
<seg id="8"> In order to protect native employment, Germany has set a relatively high threshold for bringing in foreign talents.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Germany's Immigration Law stipulates that professionals from non-EU countries should have annual salaries of no less than € 85500 in Germany, otherwise they cannot get the permit to work and live in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Schavan suggests that this qualifying amount be reduced to 40000 to € 60000.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> On July 1, the Eternal Warning Bell in the Memorial Hall of Nanjing's Jinghai Temple was tolled once again, the sound of the bell ringing melodiously.</seg>
<seg id="3"> This rich echo of history connected the mainland and Hong Kong via television, as the citizens of Nanjing and Hong Kong compatriots "shared the same occasion from the far corners of the earth" and celebrated together the tenth anniversary of Hong Kong's reversion to the motherland.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Ten years previously, at 12:00 a.m. on July 1, the sound of the tolling of the Eternal Warning Bell reverberated 155 times in the sky over the bell tower of the Memorial Hall of Nanjing's Jinghai Temple, bidding farewell to the humiliating history of the cession of Hong Kong island.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> People from all walks of life in Nanjing society gathered together in front of the gate of the smallish Memorial Hall.  They said that they wanted to give an eternal warning to themselves and to later generations not to forget history by ringing this Eternal Warning Bell with their own two hands.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> "The bell of the Eternal Warning Bell is 1.842 meters high, and the year 1842 was precisely when the 'Nanjing Treaty' was concluded at the time of the eruption of the Opium War.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The shoulder of the bell is 1.997 meters high, and 1997 was the year of Hong Kong's reversion."</seg>
<seg id="8"> The man behind the devising and casting of the Eternal Warning Bell that year, Wang Fengling, explained that "there are five 'wan' character inscriptions around the body of the bell.  The whole copper bell is in high relief, with two dragons supporting a fireball, symbolizing the fact that Hong Kong is the motherland's 'Pearl of the Orient.'  Finally, Nanjing's city flower, the plum blossom, forms the pattern on the body of the bell where the bell is struck."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Yu Xiaodong, a member of the Democratic Party and the first person back then to propose the construction of the Eternal Warning Bell sighed with emotion, saying, "Before we knew it, it has been ten years already since the reversion of Hong Kong."  He hopes that Hong Kong's tomorrow could be like the sound of that tolling bell, "resounding and melodious, ongoing and everlasting."</seg>

<seg id="1"> Three Main Functions of Modern Military Uniform</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The first is the identification function.</seg>
<seg id="3"> It is an important sign that distinguishes the armies of different countries, different military services, and between the military and civilians.</seg>
<seg id="4"> In the armies of more than 100 large and small countries of the world, although the use of military uniform is basically identical, there are no two countries' armies whose military uniforms are completely the same.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The second is the symbolic function.</seg>
<seg id="6"> To a certain extent, military uniform is both a reflection of a country's mental outlook and its national characteristics, and is also a concentrated embodiment of a country's military ability to wage war and the quality of its servicemen.</seg>
<seg id="7"> In the three main types of military uniform -- ceremonial attire, everyday uniforms, and drill uniforms -- the one that can express national prestige and military prestige to the fullest extent is none other than ceremonial attire that is well-pressed and pleasing to the eye.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The third is the protective function.</seg>
<seg id="9"> With the rapid development of high-tech and updated weaponry, improving the overall protective capacity of new-style drill uniforms to give military uniform various types of functions -- including bulletproofing, stealth protection, anti-chemical, anti-bacterial and anti-radiation functions, as well as control of the temperature, humidity and the air -- has become a key issue in the development of military uniform.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Staff Writer, Chengdu, July 3</seg>
<seg id="3"> Report by Qu Yimao and Yang Ruiyu: "We can now move into apartments as a result of the brigade party committee organ's resolution and boldness in freeing up the apartments."</seg>
<seg id="4"> Today, more than ten cadres in a communications drill brigade in Chengdu Military Command were all beaming with pleasure as they moved into apartments.  They felt full of admiration and gratitude for the way the "group" on the brigade party committee dared to confront tough obstacles in solving thorny issues.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Over the past few years, along with the replacement of personnel, an excessive part of the brigade's accommodation for family members had been occupied against regulations, making it difficult to house the cadres on active duty.  Officers and men had quite strong views about this.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The brigade had tried to free up the apartments several times, but failed to get it done each time due to all kinds of obstruction, allowing the problem to become a long-standing, big and difficult issue.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> "As long as we have the courage to do things properly and are fair and reasonable, there are no difficulties we cannot solve."</seg>
<seg id="8"> After the group on the new party committee had reached a consensus, the principal leaders appeared in person and set about thoroughly sorting out all the problems relating to occupation of apartments against regulations.</seg>
<seg id="9"> On the one hand they appealed to people's emotions and explained their reasoning, hoping that the personnel concerned would consider the whole picture; on the other hand, they explained the policies and regulations relating to military apartments, apartments built with pooled money, and economical and adequate apartments, to show the party committee's staunch determination and principled stance.</seg>
<seg id="10"> In the case of personnel who had accommodation elsewhere and were not willing to leave the additional apartments they occupied, the party committee organ promptly made contact with the work units they were in and adopted relevant measures to encourage them to take the initiative in cooperating with the work of the army.</seg>
<seg id="11"> Over two months of meticulous work, all residents occupying additional apartments in the army barracks against regulations had all moved out on schedule, and cadres who worked in the brigade were all assigned the accommodation in accordance with regulations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The way in which this brigade party committee dared to confront tough obstacles has also given rise to a chain reaction.  Several cadres who originally were unwilling to actively cooperate with the organization's allotment have now one by one also expressed their willingness to obey the organization's decisions.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The Guangdong Frontier Unit Hospital, which has set itself the task of building socialist harmony, has successively established three fair-price hospitals specially aimed at migrant laborers in Buji, Longhua and Bao'an of Shenzhen.  The registration fee for migrant laborers seeking medical advice is only 1 yuan, and discounts of 20% are available for both tests and operations.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The hospital is provided with a special "Compassionate Service Vehicle," which takes peasant migrant patients to and from the clinic free of charge, and has rolled out a migrant peasant worker "Health Service Card," whereby each person needs to pay just 7 yuan a month to enjoy 12 types of basic medical treatment consultations and guarantees.</seg>
<seg id="7"> These measures to benefit the people have already been extended to more than 12000 migrant peasant workers.</seg>
</p>
<p>

<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 28 (Correspondent Cui Junqiang) When the Olympic Games are held next year, Beijing is expected to turn into a sea of fresh flowers in hot and humid August.</seg>
<seg id="3"> By season-altering and other technological methods, scientific and research personnel have found a good way of adding more color to the Olympic Games.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> At the "Practical Research into the Selection and Cultivation of New Plant Varieties for the Summer Olympics" project evaluation meeting held on the 28th in Beijing, the experts making the evaluation came to the conclusion that by the use of new rapid-control cultivation technologies, plant species or varieties with different natural flowering seasons could blossom at the same time in the summer and reach an optimum result for people to enjoy in August when the Beijing Olympics are held.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> In the summer in Beijing, one can usually see only a dozen or so fresh flowers in full bloom, as the majority of flowering plants have either long withered or are far away from blossoming.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The scientific and research personnel worked hard to select 206 species and more than 400 varieties of plants for the Summer Olympic Games.</seg>

<seg id="3"> The manager of branded shop "On Pedder" located in the upscale Plaza Indonesia said, "We cancelled the market launch for the eco-friendly bag in view of what happened in Hong Kong.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="5"> Thousands of Hong Kong people gathered outside sale stores on the 6th, ready to rush to buy the limited quantity eco-friendly bag designed by British designer Anya Hindmarch, printed "I'm Not A Plastic Bag."  However, the stores refused to open their doors, causing the situation to become chaotic.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Germany Plans to Lower Barriers for Bringing in Specialized Skilled Workers</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Staff report, Berlin, July 1 (Correspondent Wang Huaicheng)</seg>
<seg id="3"> German Education and Research Minister Schavan said a few days ago that Germany should lower the Immigration Law restrictions on bringing in foreign specialized skilled workers, using an introduction of foreign talent to solve Germany's specialized skilled worker shortage problems.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> According to an OECD report, by 2010, Germany's labor force between 15 and 64 years old will be shrinking yearly.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Without enough immigrants, Germany's labor force by 2020 will be 6% smaller than now.</seg>
<seg id="6"> However, reports from organizations such as the Federation of German Employers' Associations and the Association for German Engineers show that there is a relatively large shortage in the current German labor market for engineers and specialized technology workers.</seg>
<seg id="7"> According to data from the German Federal Labor Agency, the German labor market had a supply shortage of about 12700 engineers and a supply shortage of about 9600 technicians in May of this year.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Germany has set high barriers for the introduction of foreign skilled workers in order to protect local employment.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Germany's Immigration Law states that specialized skilled workers from non-EU countries cannot earn less than € 85500 per year in Germany, or else cannot obtain German work and residency permits.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Schavan proposed bringing this limit down to between 40000 and € 60000.</seg>

<seg id="1"> The Ringing of the Alarm Bell at this Moment "Connects" Hong Kong with the Rest of the World in a Joint Celebration of 10 Years Since the Handover</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> On July 1, the alarm bell at Jinghai temple memorial hall in Nanjing was once again struck and rung with a melodious resound.</seg>
<seg id="3"> This echo of profound historical significance "connected" the Mainland and Hong Kong through television; citizens of Nanjing and their fellow countrymen in Hong Kong "shared this moment with the entire world" together celebrating the 10th anniversary of Hong Kong's handover to the motherland.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> At midnight on July 1 ten years ago, the air above the bell tower at Jinghai temple memorial in Nanjing reverberated to the sounds of one hundred and fifty-five strikes of the alarm bell.  It was saying adieu to the humiliating history of the cession of Hong Kong Island.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Outside the entrance to the small memorial hall, people from all walks of society in Nanjing gathered together.  They said they will use their own two hands to strike this alarm bell, to warn themselves and later generations never to forget history.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The alarm bell is 1.842 meters high and it was in 1842 that the "Nanjing Treaty" was signed, right at the time the Opium War broke out.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The shoulder of the bell is 1.997 meters high and 1997 is the year of the Hong Kong handover.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The planner and founder of the alarm bell that year, Wang Fengling, explained, "Five rows of the character '10000' encircle the body of the bell.  The entire bronze bell uses high relief sculpture and two dragons support a ball of fire which symbolizes that Hong Kong is the motherland's 'Pearl of the Orient.'  Finally, the flower of Nanjing city, plum blossom, is the figure on the bell's strikeplate."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The first member of the Democracy Party that year to propose making the alarm bell, Yu Xiaodong, said emotionally, "Before I realized it, it is already ten years since Hong Kong's return."  He hopes that Hong Kong's tomorrow can be like the sound of the bell, "bright and long, and stretching forever without end."</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> One, identification function.</seg>
<seg id="3"> To distinguish the important insignia of different nations' armies, different types of soldiers, armies and civilians.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Among the armies of over 100 large and small nations in the world, although the basic use of a military uniform is the same, the military uniforms of no two countries' armies are completely the same.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Two, symbolic function.</seg>
<seg id="6"> To a certain degree, a military uniform is the image of a nation's spirit, a reflection of its national characteristics, and is a focused embodiment of a nation's military capability and its soldiers' accomplishments.</seg>
<seg id="7"> In the three main categories of military uniform: ceremonial uniform, service uniform and training uniform, nothing is more capable of fully displaying national and military prestige than a stiff and tight-fitted, handsome-looking ceremonial uniform.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Three, protective function.</seg>
<seg id="9"> With the rapid development of new high-technology weapons, improving the overall protective performance of new types of training uniform and making military uniform bullet proof, detection proof, chemical proof, germ proof, radiation proof, as well as having temperature control, moisture control, gas control and various other functions, has become the foremost issue in military uniform development.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Staff Report, Chengdu, July 3</seg>
<seg id="3"> Report by Qu Yimao and Yang Ruiyu: "We are able to live in an apartment thanks to the resolve and determination of the Battalion Party Committee to clear out the rooms."</seg>
<seg id="4"> Today, more than ten cadres from a communication training battalion in Chengdu Military Command all look very happy as they move to an apartment block .  They are full of admiration and appreciation at the style in which "the team" of the Battalion Party Committee dared to stick to their guns and struggle against obstacles to resolve a thorny problem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> In the last few years, as personnel have been replaced, a portion of this battalion's apartments in this family dormitory building was over-occupied, contrary to regulations, which made it difficult for cadres in service to find accommodation.  Officers and men have expressed considerable objections concerning this matter.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The battalion also cleared out the apartments several times before, but due to resistance they settled the matter by leaving it unsettled, which turned this issue into a long-standing problem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> "If only one sticks to one's guns and is fair and reasonable, there are no unsolvable problems."</seg>
<seg id="8"> After the new party committee team achieved consensus, major leaders came out in person to set about completely clearing up all the problems where apartments were occupied contrary to regulations.</seg>
<seg id="9"> On the one hand, they appealed to people's emotion and explained through reason, hoping that the people concerned would consider the overall situation; on the other hand they explained clearly the related policies and regulations on military apartments, pooled housing and economic housing, and made clear the party committee's determination, resolve and standpoint on principles.</seg>
<seg id="10"> For some people with housing elsewhere yet unwilling to withdraw from over-occupied housing, the party committee promptly contacted their work unit and took corresponding steps to urge them to actively cooperate with the army's work.</seg>
<seg id="11"> After two months of painstaking work, all the residents of buildings on the campgrounds that were over-occupied against regulations moved out on schedule and the serving battalion cadres were allotted housing according to regulations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> This style in which the Battalion Party Committee dares to stick to its guns and struggle against obstacles also created a domino effect: a few cadres originally unwilling to actively cooperate with the organization's allocation, now also, one by one, expressed submission to the organization's decision.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 28 (Correspondent Cui Junqiang) When next year's Olympics are held, Beijing in August, with its high temperature and humidity, is expected to transform into a sea of fresh flowers.</seg>
<seg id="3"> By employing technology to change the flower season, and other measures, scientific researchers have found a good strategy to add color to the Olympic Games.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> At the "Summer Olympics Optimal New Flower Variety Selection and Cultivation Applications Research" project acceptance meeting held on the 28th in Beijing, assessment experts arrived at the conclusion that the use of new technology to spur and control flower cultivation will enable different flower types or varieties with different natural flower seasons to bloom in the same time in the summer, thus the best visual effect will be achieved in August when the Beijing Olympic Games will be held .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> In the Beijing summer, often only a dozen or so types of blooming flowers can be seen.  The majority of flowers have either already withered or are still a long time away from their buds opening.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Through their endeavors, scientific researchers chose 206 types and over 400 varieties of the most optimal flowers for the Summer Olympics.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> At the "2007 Olympics Flower Exhibition" to be held in Haidian Park, Beijing, around the one year countdown to the Beijing Olympic Games opening, a batch of fresh and bright-colored flowers carefully cultivated by scientific researchers, that in the past have been unable to naturally bloom in August, will welcome visitors.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Germany Plans to Lower Threshold for Attracting Talents</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> This newspaper, Berlin, July 1, (Reporter Wang Huaicheng)</seg>
<seg id="3"> Schavan, German Minister of Education and Research, said a few days ago that Germany should lower the restrictions on the importation of foreign professionals in the Immigration Law to resolve the shortage of professionals in Germany through an increase in the importation of foreign talents.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> According to the report of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the size of labor force between the age of 15 and 64 in Germany will drop every year till 2010.</seg>
<seg id="5"> If there are insufficient immigrants, Germany's labor force in 2020 will be 6 percent smaller than it is now.</seg>
<seg id="6"> However, reports of organizations including the Confederation of German Employers' Associations and the Association of German Engineers showed that in current German labor market, the shortages in engineers and skilled technicalprofessionals are bigger.</seg>
<seg id="7"> According to data from the German Federal Labor Office, as of this May, there was a shortage of approximately 12700 people in the supply of engineers and a shortage of 9600 people in the supply of technicians in the German labor market.</seg>
<seg id="8"> In order to protect the employment of its nationals, Germany has set a rather high threshold for the importation of foreign talents.</seg>
<seg id="9"> The German Immigration Law stipulates that the annual salaries of professionals from non-EU countries must not be lower than € 85500, otherwise they will not be able to obtain a work and residence permit in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Schavan suggested lower this limit to 40000 to € 60000.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Alarm Bell Tolls "Connects with" Hong Kong to Celebrate 10th Anniversary of Return to Homeland Together from Afar</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> On July 1, the alarm bell in the Nanjing Jinghai Temple Memorial Hall was tolled again, giving out melodious chimes.</seg>
<seg id="3"> The heavy historical echo "connected" the Mainland with Hong Kong through television station. Residents of Nanjing shared the moment with Hong Kong compatriots from afar to celebrate the 10th Anniversary of the return of Hong Kong to its motherland together.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> At midnight on July 1 a decade ago, 155 alarming bell chimes reverberated in the sky above the bell tower of the Nanjing Jinghai Temple Memorial Hall, a farewell to the humiliating history of the ceding of Hong Kong Island.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> People from all circles in Nanjing gathered in front of the small memorial hall. They said that they wanted to toll the alarm bell with their own two hands to warn themselves and descendants never to forget about history.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> "The alarm bell is 1.842 meters tall while 1842 was precisely when the Treaty of Nanjing was signed during the Opium War.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The shoulder of the bell is 1.997 meters tall and 1997 was the year when Hong Kong was returned to its motherland."</seg>
<seg id="8"> Wang Fengling, the person who designed and cast the alarm bell that very year, explained, "Five narrow patterns of the character 'wan' go around the body of the bell. The entire copper bell uses high relief with two dragons holding up the fireball to symbolize that Hong Kong is the 'Pearl of the Orient' of the motherland. In the end, plum blossom, the city flower of Nanjing, is used as contrasting patterns of the body of the bell."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Yu Xiaodong, member of the democratic party who was the first person to suggest building the alarm bell that very year, said with emotion, "Before you knew it, it has already been 10 years since Hong Kong was returned to the motherland." He hoped that the future of Hong Kong can be "bright, melodious, and continue forever" just like the bell chimes.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Three Functions of Modern Army Uniforms</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The first is its identification function.</seg>
<seg id="3"> An important mark to differentiate between armies of different countries, between different services and arms, and between the army and the civilians.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Even though army uniforms have basically the same use among armies of over 100 large and small countries in the world, no army uniforms of any two countries' armies are identical.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The second is its symbolic function.</seg>
<seg id="6"> To a certain extent, army uniform is a reflection of the spirit and distinctive feature of a nation. It also fully reflects the fighting ability and the soldiers' quality of a country's army.</seg>
<seg id="7"> In the three major types of army uniforms - dress uniform, service uniform, and combat and training uniform - there is nothing like the crisp and beautiful dress uniform that can fully display the might of the country and the army.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The third is its protective function.</seg>
<seg id="9"> With the rapid development in new and high-tech weapons and equipment, to enhance the comprehensive protective ability of new and high-tech combat and training uniforms so as to provide army uniforms with various functions including bulletproof, counter-reconnaissance, chemical-proof, germs-proof, radiation-proof, as well as temperature, dampness, and air adjustments has become the priority in the development of army uniforms.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> This newspaper, Chengdu, July 3</seg>
<seg id="3"> Reported by Qu Yimao, Yang Ruiyu: "We must thank the brigade's Party committee for its determination and courage in the eviction so that we can live in an apartment."</seg>
<seg id="4"> Today, more than 10 cadres of a communication training brigade in Chengdu Military Area Command who moved into apartments were all beaming with joy. They were full of respect and gratitude for the earnest and courageous way "the group" at the brigade Party Committee handled difficult issues.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> A few years ago, with personnel changes, some of the apartments in the residential building of the brigade were illegally occupied which caused a shortage in accommodation for cadres in active service. The officers and soldiers had quite a few complaints about it.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The brigade had tried evictions a few times before but due to various obstructions, nothing was settled every time, thus turning this into a complicated and long-pending problem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> "As long as one is persistent and reasonable, all problems can be resolved."</seg>
<seg id="8"> After the new Party committee group reached a consensus, the key leadership started to thoroughly straighten out all problems of illegal occupation of apartments themselves.</seg>
<seg id="9"> On the one hand, they resorted to emotional appeal through reasoning and hoped that the people involved would consider the big picture. At the same time, they clearly explained relevant policy stipulations on apartments, houses built by collected funds, and utility apartments of the army, and declared the Party committee's determination, principles and position.</seg>
<seg id="10"> For people who had housing elsewhere but were unwilling to return the illegally occupied housing, the Party committee immediately contacted the units to which they belonged and adopted corresponding measures to urge them to voluntarily cooperate with the work of the brigade.</seg>
<seg id="11"> After two months of meticulous work, all residents in the barrack site who had illegally occupied the apartments moved away on time. All cadres in the brigade who were in active service were given housing according to the rule.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The persistent and courageous work style of the brigade Party committee also created a chain effect. The few cadres who were unwilling to positively cooperate with the assignment of the organization in the beginning all indicated that they will follow the decision of the organization now.</seg>
