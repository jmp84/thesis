<p>
<seg id="3">Borovkov said that during an interview with a reporter of the Guardian  in Britain this April, Berezovsky announced that he was preparing to mount a "palace coup" in Russia and confirmed that he was providing financial support to representatives of the Rightist elites who opposed to the policies of the authorities.</seg>
</p>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Doctors and patients thus paid close attention to the safety of Avandia.</seg>

<seg id="5">Statistics showed that within approximately a month after the safety warning was issued, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration received 357 reports on adverse reactions caused by Avandia, 38 of which were reports of death.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2">An official of the U.S. Department of Defense said on the 23rd that due to the War on Iraq and changes in global situation, the U.S. Department of Defense is reconsidering its plan to cut approximately half of the U.S. troops in Europe formulated in 2002.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">U.S. media quoted a Department of Defense official as saying that since the War on Iraq is still going on and the US-Russia and US-Iran relationships are deteriorating, the leadership at the Department of Defense raised doubts about the feasibility of the plan to cut the troops in Europe.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In 2002, the then Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld announced that the United States would reduce the original 113000 troops in Europe to 71000 by 2012 in order to build a new "small and elite" army.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The number of U.S. troops in Europe is currently reduced to 100000.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">However, Craddock, commander-in-chief of U.S. European Command, submitted a report to the current Secretary of Defense Gates in June questioning the above reduction plan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The report said that while the U.S. troops in Europe are being reduced, many troops are be rotated into Iraq and Afghanistan to fight, thus causing a shortage in U.S. troops in Europe. As a result, they cannot cooperate normally with their European allies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The report suggested a halt to the plan to cut U.S. troops in Europe.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Relevant experts in the United States argued that the above phenomenon shows that the prolonged War on Iraq has disrupted the original adjustment plan of the U.S. army.</seg>

<seg id="2">This newspaper, Reported by Staff Reporters Cao Jiawei, Zhu Chunbin: On June 18, in the training class for cadres of the Department of People's Armed Forces in Jingjiang City, Jiangsu Province, the tutorial To Win the Psychological Battle under Information Conditions taught by Lu Yuqing, chief of the Xilai County Department of People's Armed Forces, was well received by all students taking part in the training.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">This was the new change brought about by the concentrated effort of the city's Department of People's Armed Forces to elevate the comprehensive qualities of the cadres of the Department of People's Armed Forces through charging them with heavy tasks in accordance with reality of their positions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In the beginning of the year, during grassroots research, the Party committee of the Department of People's Armed Forces found that some cadres of the People's Armed Forces had long term of service and held too many concurrent duties, thus failed to focus their energy on doing armed forces work.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">To this end, they adopted measures including centralized training, coaching seminars, and reliance on training offered by local Party schools to provide regular training to cadres of the Department of People's Armed Forces and concentrated efforts on resolving issues including the narrow range of knowledge and one-dimensional professional qualifications of the cadres of the Department of People's Armed Forces.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">They integrated central tasks and boldly assigned duties to cadres of the Department of People's Armed Forces, charged them with heavy tasks, and elevated their work abilities through on-the-job training.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">At the same time, they actively coordinated with local organizations and departments and jointly formulated the Program for Cadres of the Department of People's Armed Forces to Compete for Job Positions that clearly stipulated that chiefs of the Department of Armed Forces must join the team of Party committee at the same level and not to hold other concurrent duties;</seg>

For cadres of the Department of People's Armed Forces who are relatively old and cannot adapt to grassroots armed forces work, they made adjustments and exchanges immediately. For compatriots who had good comprehensive qualities and strong work abilities, they promoted and employed them.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2">This newspaper, reported by Xue Bingjian, Reporter Xu Yeqing: The phenomena of difficult organization, limited resources, and lack of coordination in education encountered by small, scattered, remote, and independent units will become history for a base of the Second Artillery.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The reporters recently learned that after half a year of pilot, the base promulgated the Enactment Measures to Implement Ideological and Political Education Syllabus that cover several ideological and political education cooperation zones in all small, scattered, remote, and independent units at the base. The measures are officially in operation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In order to promote the effective implementation of the Ideological and Political Education Syllabus, the base allocated resources to conduct an in-depth survey on the ideological and political education situation in small, scattered, remote, and independent units in the beginning of the year. They sorted out key issues that affected and restricted the time, personnel, and effects of the education and initially formed the new educational model of cooperation zones for small, scattered, remote, and independent units.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The details of the cooperation zones are, break away from the restrictions of authorized force of the units, and designate a unit at the brigade or regiment level in a sub-area where small, scattered, remote, and independent units are relatively concentrated to take the lead to conduct standardized planning of thematic education. Units under different affiliations will attend classes together nearby or to hold long-distance discussions by means of video system.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">They adopt the practice of integrating teaching rotation and competing for job positions to conduct consolidated allocation of education force. Education hardware in the sub-area is put under centralized use. Information and data of all units, as well as education experiences are shared and exchanged. Report tours by model sub-areas and sharing of educational experiences among officers and men are regularly organized.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Each cooperation unit has set up full-time education contacts and part-time education information gatherers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">On this foundation, all cooperation zones have also established systems for seeking help in difficult questions, discussions on major educational topics, notification of emergency ideological situations, and examination and assessment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Zhang Shengmin, chief of the Political Department at the base, told reporters that the establishment of political education cooperation zones both reduces waste in educational resources and deepens educational effects.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Some political instructors worry that they will lose points in front of officers and men from outside units, so they take the initiative to learn new knowledge and explore new educational methods.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Officers and men being taught also actively digest educational contents in fear that they will sound unprofessional in front of officers and men from neighboring units during discussion, differentiation, and analysis.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">In this case, the enthusiasm of both the educators and the ones who receive the education is effectively stimulated.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2">Article 8 of the draft amendment of the Law on Lawyers recently submitted to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress for deliberation stipulates: people who have professional experiences in the research or teaching of law, with advanced professional titles or corresponding professional competence, may obtain a lawyer's license, and get approval from judicial departments under the State Council.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">(June 28, China Youth Daily)</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">There is a difference between the "theoretical circle" and the "practical circle" in law. The former mainly includes "abstract behaviors" such as the teaching and research of law while the latter are more "concrete behaviors" such as engaging in litigations, legal consultations, and legal services.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The phenomenon of "scorning of each other" has long existed between the theoretical circle and the practical circle in law. The theoretical circle argues that the practical circle lacks necessary legal attainments and is simply mechanical "legalist" while the direction of criticism of the practical circle on the theoretical circle is that "theories cannot guide practice".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">In regards to such a divergence of division of labor, what law can do is to remain neutral instead of supporting any one side with mightiness.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">However, the "chartered lawyer system" in the Law on Lawyers has objectively endorsed the judgment that the theoretical circle is superior to the practical circle in law.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">In fact, for some experts and scholars who engage in pure research and teaching of legal theories such as the history of legal system and international laws, no matter how thoroughly accomplished they are in theories, they will still be out of step with practical legal issues.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">In this case, chartered lawyer system has no doubt set a "bad precedent" with extremely harmful effects on the qualification confusion in the practical circle in law.</seg>

<seg id="9">The situation increases once one enters the door. No matter how bright one's mood is, it will still be spoiled and one will feel insipid.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The media once reported that many foreign visitors to Xi'an spoke very highly of the scenic spots and historical sites of Xi'an. However, they could not understand why heaps of peddlers were allowed to peddle everywhere.</seg>

<seg id="1">"Reward for Voluntary Surrender of Low-Income Subsidy" Fails to Stand Close Scrutiny</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="2">The Jianguomen neighborhood office in Dongcheng District, Beijing handed out items such as refrigerators as rewards for 12 low-income subsidy recipient families that voluntarily  surrendered their low-income subsidies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">(The Beijing News, July 10)</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The author is happy about the improvements in life of these families. However, I have mixed feelings about the wording of "voluntary surrender of low-income subsidy" and the practice of "giving out rewards".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Vice-chairman of Jianguomen neighborhood office said, "In order to address problems including defrauding low-income subsidy and so on, encouraging voluntary surrender of low-income subsidy is to set an example for other low-income subsidy recipient households."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">If this example encourages other low-income subsidy recipients to turn the corner through efforts of their own, then it is indeed worth promoting. However, if one wants to use this to "inspire" people who have been defrauding low-income subsidy for a long time, then it is somewhat naive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The work to differentiate and straighten up real and false low-income subsidy recipient households should rely more on the law.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Relevant departments should strengthen responsibilities that low-income subsidy recipient households need to fulfill when enjoying low-income subsidy: For example, inform changes in number of family members and income in a timely manner, report employment situation, and subjected to regular review. Meanwhile, relevant departments should step up efforts in supervision and inspection.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">After all, only the "surrender of low-income subsidy according to the law" is the long-term plan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Who pays for the material rewards given to families that surrender their low-income subsidies by the neighborhood office?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">As a level-one government agency, the expenses of the neighborhood office are shouldered by financial appropriation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Then, should this sum of taxpayers' money be spent?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">On the one hand, families that surrender their low-income subsidies have proven that they have certain abilities to be 'self-sufficient". On the other hand, aren't there still people who apply for low-income subsidy?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Government appropriation that is labeled as life-saving money should render timely help instead of making what is good still better.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">On July 10, Liu Gangyi, the first Secretary of the township Party committee publicly nominated and directly elected in the country and the Secretary of the Party committee of Mulan Town in Xindu District, Chengdu City was subjected to democratic evaluation for the fourth time since he took office. He had an approval rating of 97 percent.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">(Yesterday, the Beijing News)</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The "one who serves others" that Liu Gangyi referred to is perhaps more truthful and convincing than "the one who serves others" referred to by some appointed cadres.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The biggest advantage of public nomination and direct election over appointment system is that it is mainly ordinary Party members and the people who determine the origin of the power of the former while the latter is mainly appointed by higher-level organizations, whereas the direction from which power originates has established that the former must give accountability to the people top priority.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The origin of power and to whom one is responsibleare fundamental factors in deciding how an electee conducts his work.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Some people challenge that such a "democratic evaluation" is more like a "democracy show".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">My opinion is that having such form of democratic evaluation is better than not having any.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Given considerations to the history and current situation of the building of democratic politics at the grassroots level in China, I believe that direct public election is already a major breakthrough. Democratic evaluation is an important component of this unprecedented undertaking. It should not be underestimated in the advancement of building democratic politics at the grassroots level.</seg>

<seg id="2">The 2-2 score was reasonable and was acceptable to the Chinese team if judging from the result of the game alone. The key was that the process of the game was somewhat regrettable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">If the Iranian team led by 2-0, then the Chinese team tied the score, that would definitely make Chinese fans feel very differently. It would bolster a lot of morale. Unfortunately, the situation was precisely the opposite.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Not only had Sun Jihai, Sun Xiang, Shao Jiayi, and Zheng Zhi played in Europe before, Li Weifeng and the others are also battle-hardened veterans. They are experienced and knowledgeable. Theoretically, there should not be any problem with their mental qualities.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="9">This time, the Chinese team was regrettably pressed to tie with the Iranian team. The reason was probably the ineffectiveness in moving players on the field.</seg>

<seg id="10">The Iranian team substituted two people while they were trailing behind and the situation was immediately improved.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The Chinese team also substituted three players in the second half but the outcome was not good.</seg>

<seg id="7">However, the veteran goalkeeper, who had played in the Spain's First Division League, the English Premier League, and the Germany's First Division League, stated that his final decision rests on his family, "My child is nine years old already and he followed me to three different countries and studied in three different schools. My choice now must seek what's the best for my family."</seg>

<seg id="8">In the Gold Cup Final that just ended recently, Keller had a stellar performance and helped the U.S. team won the championship.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">In the Copa America this year, he was still entrusted with important task by head coach Bradley. However, one man alone cannot win. The U.S. team, which went to battle with "young guards", was simply no match for strong South American teams such as Argentina and Paraguay. The goal that he kept was penetrated seven times in two games.</seg>
