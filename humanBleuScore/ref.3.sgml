</p>
<p>
<seg id="2">Borovkov, lawyer of the Russian oligarch Berezovsky exiled in London, said on July 2 that the Russian FSB has formally filed a new charge against his client, accusing Berezovsky of "conspiring to plot a coup against the state and attempting to seize Russian political power by violence."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">In an interview with a reporter of Britain's The Guardian in April this year, Berezovsky declared he was preparing to mount a "palace coup" in Russia, confirming he was providing financial assistance to representatives of the right-wing elites who were against the government policy, Borovkov noted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The Russian FSB's Investigation Bureau immediately began criminal investigation in Berezovsky in compliance with article 278, Violent Seizure of Power, of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation and formally filed applicable charges to the Savelovsky Court in Moscow in recent days.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">It is learned that in February 2006, the Office of the Russian Persecutor General had filed criminal charges against Berezovsky, on the same ground that the exiled oligarch confirmed his attempt to obtain Russian political power by force.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">As Berezovsky had been in exile abroad and could not be extradited, Russia halted probing of the case temporarily in January 2007.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The Savelovsky Court initiated another criminal case against the exiled oligarch, in which the Office of the Russian Persecutor General accused Berezovsky of embezzling funds of 214000000 rubles from a Russian airway and laundering 16000000 rubles. After hearings, the court has decided to postpone court probing until July 12 and will appoint a state defense attorney for the defendant during this time.</seg>

<seg id="2">According to a US media report on the 15th, there has recently been a tendency of significant increase in the number of adverse reaction reports, such as cardiac diseases, caused by the anti-diabetes drug Avandia in the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The US Food and Drug Administration issued a safety warning in May this year, advising diabetes patients to take Avandia with caution, because scientists issued a study report in an edition of the New England Journal of Medicine published on May 21, saying the best-selling drug would significantly increase the rates of heart attack and death in patients.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The safety of Avandia has thus been closely watched by doctors and patients.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">According to statistics, within roughly a month after the safety warning, the US FDA received 357 reports of adverse reactions caused by Avandia, 38 of which are death reports.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Yet the FDA only received 50 and 73 reports of adverse reactions respectively in January and February this year.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The adverse reactions were as minor as blisters and as serious as sudden death due to heart attack.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">However, drug experts at the US FDA believe it is yet too early to conclude that Avandia is unsafe.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The FDA is going to hold a hearing regarding the safety of Avandia on July 30.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Avandia, introduced in 1999, is an insulin sensitizer for treating type II diabetes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Some 6000000 diabetes patients around the world has taken or is taking Avandia.</seg>

<seg id="2">For a long time, a large number of health professionals and skilled personnel have been rooted in rural areas, toiling for and devoting their youth to the base-level healthcare cause and the health of villagers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Jiangxi Province decided the other day to award those health professionals and skilled personnel rooted in rural areas for at least 30 years the "merit of honor for 30 years of service in rural healthcare."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">According to Jiangxi Provincial Health Department, any health professional who does professional or skilled health work at a government-run township hospital and has a diploma in medicine from a secondary vocational school or above and a junior professional or technical designation or above, if he or she has worked for at least 30 years, either successive or combined, at a township hospital, a township blood and disease prevention group or a leprosy village and is now on the job or post, he or she is covered by the award.</seg>

<seg id="6">For eligible rural health professionals, in addition to awarding them a certificate and a medal of the "merit of honor for 30 years of service in rural healthcare," Jiangxi Province will also give priority and appropriate preferential treatment in exams of professional designations, assessment and engagement,</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">where a separate pass line will be set for professional exams of senior designations; assessment will primarily depend upon actual competence, with appropriately relaxed research and thesis requirements and exemption from the foreign language exam; and priority is given in the engagement once the qualification is acquired.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2">A US Defense Department official said on the 23rd that the US Pentagon is reconsidering a 2002 plan to cut US troops stationed in Europe by about half because of the war in Iraq and changes in the world situation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">With the ongoing Iraq War and worsened US relations with Russia and Iran, the Pentagon leadership has questioned the feasibility of the plan to slash troops stationed in Europe, the US media said, quoting a Defense Department official.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In 2002, the then Defense Secretary Rumsfeld announced the US would reduce troops in Europe from 113000 to 71000 by 2012, in order to create a "lean and effective" new force.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Total US troops stationed in Europe have decreased to 100000 so far.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">However, Craddock, Commander of the US European Command, submitted a report to current Defense Secretary Gates in June this year, in which he questioned the aforesaid reduction plan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The report says the slash of US troops stationed in Europe is accompanied by rotational transfer of many forces to Iraq and Afghanistan for battles, which leads to a shortage of US military personnel stationed in Europe, such that they are unable to conduct regular cooperation with European allies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The report recommends halting the plan to cut US troops in Europe.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Experts in the US believe the phenomenon above indicates that the Iraq War has been such a long drag that it has disrupted the original adjustment plan of the US military.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2">By Cao Jiawei and Zhu Chunbin, PLA Daily: On June 18, at an intensive training program for armed force cadres in the city of Jingjiang, Jiangsu Province, the lecture Win the Psychological Warfare in the Context of Informationization by Lu Yuqing, Director of the Xilai Town Department of People's Armed Force, received positive comments amongst all participants.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">This was a fresh change as a result of the city's Department of People's Armed Force loading burdens onto armed force cadres and working to boost the overall quality of armed force cadres in line with the reality of different posts.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">At the beginning of this year, when doing grassroot research, the Party committee of the Department of People's Armed Force found that some armed force cadres did not focus on doing work related to the armed forces due to long years of service and multiple duties.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Therefore, they have conducted training regularly for armed force cadres using such methods such as intensive training, meeting as a way of training, relying on local Party school to provide training, with a view to address problems such as narrow knowledge spectrum and lack of versatile work skills.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">In line with the core responsibilities, it has assigned tasks and loaded burdens onto armed force cadres boldly to improve their competency through on-the-job practice.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">In addition, by actively coordinating with local organization departments, they jointly formulated the Scheme of Position Competitions Amongst Armed Force Cadres, which explicitly requires head of an armed force department to be on the Party committee of the same level without concurrently assuming other jobs;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">and set up an adjustment and exchange mechanism for armed force cadres, whereby some armed force cadres who are older or not suitable for grassroot armed force positions are adjusted or exchanged in a timely fashion, while comrades with good overall quality and high competency are promoted.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2">By Xue Bingjian and Reporter Xu Yeqing, PLA Daily: The phenomenon where education at small, dispersed, remote and direct (SDRD) units is hard to organize, lacking in resources and individually carried out will be history in a base of the Second Artillery Force.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The reporters learned recently that after a six-month pilot project, the base handed down Steps to Implement "Ideological and Political Education Outline" and several ideological and political education collaboration areas that cover all its SDRD units have officially begun operation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">To promote effective implementation of the Ideological and Political Education Outline, the base organized efforts to perform in-depth investigation and research into the status of ideological and political education at SDRD units early this year and sorted out key problems that affected and constrained the time, people and effects of the education, creating the new education pattern of collaboration areas for SDRD units.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The specific practice of the collaboration areas is to break the bound of units and in an area where the SDRD units are relatively concentrated, designate a brigade or regiment level unit as the coordinator, which will conduct centralized planning of theme education. Units of different relationships of subordination and affiliation attend lectures together at a close location or hold remote discussions with video systems.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Education capabilities are centrally allocated by way of rotational lectures in conjunction with position competitions; education hardware within a area is used in a coordinated manner, information and data, as well as experience in education of each unit are shared and exchanged, report tours about typical examples in an area are organized regularly, and officers and soldiers discuss what they have learned from study.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Each collaboration area has put in place a full-time education contact and a part-time education information collector.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Building on this, the collaboration areas also established systems of seeking help with hard problems, joint consultations on major educational topics, emergency briefing of ideological situations, and that of assessment and evaluation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Zhang Shengmin, director of the base's Political Department, told the reporters that establishing the political education collaboration areas has not only minimized waste of educational resources, but also deepened the effects of education.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Some political instructors voluntarily learn new knowledge and seek new methods of education for fear of losing marks in front of officers and soldiers from other units.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Officers and soldiers receiving education also digest what is taught, for fear of saying anything unprofessional in front of officers and soldiers from friendly and neighboring units during discussion and analysis.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">As such, passions of the educators and the educated are both effectively inspired.</seg>

</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Liu Lefei, Chief Investment Officer of China Life Co., Ltd, believes that due to the appreciation of RMB and promising domestic capital market, insurance institutions will not invest overseas by buying foreign currencies on a large scale in the short run, which means insurance QDII will not drain cash from the domestic stock market anytime soon.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The report says quite a few insurance institutions hold the same view.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">According to a report in Taiwan's United Daily, Chen Shui-bian on the 30th questioned judges, prosecutors and investigators for intervening, influencing or even attempting to manipulate election campaigns of candidates from different parties out of political factors or election considerations and said he hoped the phenomenon did not exist in Taiwan, but it might be very difficult.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="5">In response to Chen Shui-bian's questioning, President of Taiwan "Judicial Yuan" Weng Yueh-sheng kept a low key with no responses, while "Secretary-General" Fan Kuang-chun appointed Kao Chin-chih to speak on behalf of the "Judicial Yuan."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Kao Chin-chih said both the fundamental law of Taiwan and "Judges Code of Conduct" state explicitly that judges should stay beyond parties and must not participate in party activities or assist with election campaigns; all judges have carefully observed relevant restrictions and the "Judicial Yuan" believes all judges are behaving very well.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">(June 28, China Youth Daily)</seg>

<seg id="4">There are "theorists" and "practitioners" in law, where the former primarily involve "abstract behaviors" such as legal teaching and research, while the latter are more of "concrete behaviors" such as litigations, legal counseling and legal services.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="5">For a long time, there has been mutual contempt between legal "theorists" and "practitioners." "Theorists" think "practitioners" are merely mechanical "legal dogmatists" lacking necessary attainments in the science of law, while criticisms of "practitioners" about "theorists" are directed at the "inability of theories to guide practice."</seg>

</p>
<p>

<seg id="6">Such examples are indeed worth promoting if they are to encourage other people enjoying the minimum living allowance to get out of difficulties through their own efforts; they are, however, a bit naive if the purpose is to "move" those who have cheated on the minimum living allowance for long.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">In distinguishing between and cleaning up real and fake households entitled to the minimum living allowance, what should be relied on more is the law.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Competent authorities should highlight the obligations of households entitled to the minimum living allowance while they enjoy the minimum living standard allowance: for example, informing of changes in family members and income in a timely manner, reporting the employment situation, undergoing regular reviews etc. And competent authorities should intensify supervision and inspection.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="10">Who will pay for the in-kind rewards given by the subdistrict to the households who opt out of the minimum living standard scheme?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">As a level of governmental organizations, the spending of a subdistrict is covered by fiscal allocation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Yet should this money of the taxpayers be spent?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">On the one hand, by opting out of the minimum living standard scheme, the households prove to have certain capacity to "sustain themselves;" on the other hand, aren't there still people claiming the minimum living standard allowance?</seg>
</p>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="2">Solely from the result of the game, a score of 2-2 is reasonable and also acceptable to the Chinese team. What's essential is the process of the game, which is somewhat disappointing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">If it was the Iranian team who led 2-0 before the Chinese team equalized the score, this would definitely give Chinese soccer fans different feelings and significantly boost morale. Unfortunately, things were just the opposite.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">A good start without a good ending could be said a chronic problem of the Chinese team.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The Chinese team often does not know how to play soccer under favorable circumstances. The conventional view is that Chinese players have less than satisfactory psychological quality.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">This is indeed a reason why the Chinese team could not have a "good ending."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">However, seen from today's game of the Chinese team, it seems this is not completely true.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">People like Li Weifeng are experienced veteran players, let alone people like Sun Jihai, Sun Xiang, Shao Jiayi and Zheng Zhi who have played soccer in Europe. They have broad experience and knowledge, and should not have problematic psychological quality logically speaking.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The Chinese team was unfortunately forced into a draw by the Iranian team this time, most probably because of improper deployment of players.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The Iranian team substituted with two people while trailing behind and the situation improved instantly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The Chinese team also substituted with three players, but the result was not good.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">To overcome the problem of having a good start without a good ending, the source of the problem must be spotted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">As long as the problem is spotted, it may not be difficult to find a solution to redress the problem.</seg>

<seg id="3">an important symbol to distinguish among armies of different nations, among different armed services, and between troops and civilians.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Although the purposes of military uniforms are basically the same in the armed forces of some 100 nations big or small around the world, no armed forces of any two nations have identical military uniforms.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Second is the symbolizing function.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">To some extent, military uniforms not only reflect a country's vitality and national characteristics, but also centrally showcases the combating capabilities and servicemen qualities of a country's armed forces.</seg>
</p>

<seg id="9">With the rapid development of new and high-tech weapons, it has become a paramount issue in the development of military uniforms to improve the comprehensive protective performance of new combat &amp; training uniforms, so that military uniforms have various functions, such as protecting from bullets, reconnaissance, chemistry, bacteria and radiation, as well as conditioning the temperature, humidity and air.</seg>

<seg id="3">By Qu Yimao and Yang Ruiyu: "The fact that we can live in an apartment is attributed to the determination and resolution of the battalion's Party committee office to vacate houses."</seg>
</p>
<p>

</p>

<seg id="5">A few years earlier, with staff changing and being replaced, some homes in the battalion's family dormitory building were over-occupied in violation of rules, which brought housing difficulties to cadres on active service. Both officers and soldiers are quite unhappy over it.</seg>

<seg id="6">The battalion had tried to vacate the homes several times, but left it unsettled because of various resistance, making this problem a hard nut to crack.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">"So long as we dare to get serious and are reasonable, there are no difficult problems that we can't solve."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Once the new Party committee reached the consensus, principal leaders went out personally to begin a thorough cleanup regarding the problem of irregular housing occupation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">They touched people sentimentally and enlightened them sensibly on the one hand, hoping that those involved could put the overall situation into perspective; on the other hand, they clarified applicable policies and rules of the troops about apartments, pool funded housing and economically affordable housing, expressing the resolute determination and fundamental stance of the Party committee.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">For those people who had housing elsewhere, but were reluctant to return the over-occupied housing, the Party committee office made timely contact with their units and took necessary measures to urge them give cooperation to the troops' work on voluntary basis.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">After two months of attentive efforts, all tenants in the barrack complex who over-occupied housing in violation of rules moved out on schedule, and the battalion's cadres on active service were all allocated housing in compliance with policies.</seg>
