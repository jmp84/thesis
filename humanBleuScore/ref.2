Nearly 500 People Dead in India's Monsoon Flooding
According to reports from officials and media, the death toll from torrential rain caused by this year's monsoons throughout India has climbed to 474.
Press Trust of India quoted the government's Disaster Relief and Rehabilitation Minister Kadam as disclosing today that one after another, various Indian provinces started experiencing rainy season in the last week.  There were serious economic losses and numerous casualties everywhere.  The current known death toll in Maharashtra Province alone is 358, where India's biggest city Mumbai is located.
The report noted that Kadam expressed the above to media reporters when he was on inspection in Mumbai.
He said that Maharashtra Province, also India's largest cotton producing area, is a sea of water.  A total of 27 towns and about 2000 villages were seriously flooded, with over 10000 disaster victims moved to safe shelters.
One after another from south to north, all throughout India started experiencing rainy season a week ago.  Residents in various provinces welcomed the torrential rain as the end of a long period of drought.  However, they did not expect the rain to be unusually strong.  The rain became a disaster, with roads becoming rivers, houses in low-lying districts fully submerged in water, and traffic becoming almost paralyzed.  Statistics to date show that about 500 people were sadly killed as a result of the floods.
Djokovic Withdraws from Wimbledon Tennis Championship; Nadal Advances to Finals
Nadal, the Spanish "King of Clay," met Serbian master Djokovic today in the men's singles semifinal of the Wimbledon Championship.  Toward the end of the match, Djokovic was injured and could not continue fighting, giving up and withdrawing.  Nadal won and advanced to the finals.

Aside from getting broken and losing the first set due to a slow start, Nadal took one-sided leads in both the second and third sets.
UN Special Envoy Opens Nuclear Negotiations; Iran Maintains Tough Stance
UN IAEA Deputy Director Heinonen opened talks with Iranian officials in Tehran today to once again try to resolve the stand-off caused by Iran's nuclear program.
However, Iranian President Ahmadinejad remained defiant despite mounting pressure of more UN sanctions.
Ahmadinejad insisted Iran would not halt uranium enrichment, but welcomed the latest talks.
He said, "The trend of installing centrifuges can be slowed down or accelerated.  This is an execution issue.  But no one should expect us to give up our rights.  We will not stop this trend."
His comments came after Heinonen arrived in Tehran.
Heinonen's purpose for this trip is to establish a set of plans to resolve "outstanding issues" triggered by Iran's nuclear program.
With Tehran failing to freeze uranium enrichment, the UN has already imposed two sets of sanctions on Iran.
The Islamic Republic News Agency reported that Heinonen opened talks with officials headed by Vaeedi, Iran's deputy secretary for international affairs in the Supreme National Security Council.
Iranian delegates to the talks also include Saidi, deputy head of the Atomic Energy Organization, and Soltanieh, envoy to the IAEA.
State of Emergency Ends; Palestinian Prime Minister Fayyad to Set up New Government
Today is the end of the one-month state of emergency implemented by the Palestinian Authority after Hamas militants attacked and occupied the Gaza Strip.  Prime Minister Fayyad tendered resignation temporarily, but was thereupon tasked with responsibility for setting up a new government.
Agriculture and Social Affairs Minister Habash told AFP, "Prime Minister Fayyad submitted his written resignation to President Abbas.  The president accepted it and at the same time asked him to set up a new cabinet government with responsibility for handling daily affairs."
Abbas confidant Amr told AFP that Fayyad had submitted his written resignation, but Abbas ordered him to "execute his current duties until he sets up a new government."
The submission of a written resignation by Fayyad, a much respected economist, was only a procedural resignation and will not affect his prime minister status.
Fayyad started leading the Palestinian emergency cabinet from the 17th of last month, with responsibility for executing the state of emergency order announced by Abbas after Hamas violently attacked and occupied Gaza.
According to the constitution of the Palestinian autonomous government, a state of emergency cannot exceed 30 days without parliamentary approval.  However, the autonomous parliament is now paralyzed.
The authority of the emergency government ends today.

Chinanews.com, Lanzhou, July 10 (Huang Dang)
This afternoon, the Price Control Administration of Lanzhou City invited relevant departments to hold a forum on price limits for beef noodles.
It was learned at the press conference that departments including the city's price control administration came together to announce the ceiling price.  This was mainly because the price of beef noodles went up by too much, exceeding what ordinary residents can afford.

"The government action is meant to consider the economic ability of ordinary residents in this area.  We conducted cost research before announcing the ceiling price," said the director of the Price Control Administration of Lanzhou City.
On the 26th of last month, four Lanzhou City departments, including the Price Control Administration, the Industry and Commerce Administration, and the Health Administration, joined hands in implementing an upper limit for the price of beef noodles in the city, attracting a lot of attention once the news was disclosed.
As understood, this forum aims to listen extensively to opinions from various circles, soliciting views and suggestions for the next-step specific management measures to be issued; additionally, according to the disclosed information, Lanzhou will hold a press conference tomorrow.
This will be the second press conference held by Lanzhou City regarding the beef noodle price increase matter.

Wang Yan's Injury Status Improves; "Perseveres" in Sitting on a Stool; Muscle Strength in Arms Recovers by "Two Grades"
"Wang Yan can already sit on a stool, but not for too long or she will feel lightheaded," Wu Xiqin, head of the Zhejiang Sports Bureau's gymnastics center, told reporters yesterday.
Before this, the injury status of Wang Yan, who was injured during competition, was consistently improving.  Compared to 10-plus days ago, the recovery of muscle strength in her right and left arms went up by "two grades."
On the 4th of this month when Wang Yan was transferred to the special care unit from the ICU (intensive care unit) of Shanghai 6th People's Hospital, her right arm muscle strength was grade 2-3, and left arm muscle strength was grade 1.
Just less than half a month later, there has been further improvement in the muscle strength of Wang Yan's arms.
"The doctor said muscle strength in Wang Yan's right hand has reached higher than grade 4, which is only one grade lower than the normal grade 5.  Muscle strength in her left hand is also above grade 3," said Wu Xiqin.
That is to say, muscle strength in Wang Yan's arms has recovered by "two grades" in less than half a month.
A little while ago, Wang Yan could already persevere in sitting in bed for five minutes with the help of the doctor.
Hospital rehabilitation experts had originally planned to let Wang Yan do ground-touching exercises last weekend under protection of the rehabilitation bed.
However, the ground-touching practice had to be postponed temporarily due to Wang Yan's current recovery situation.
Wu Xiqin said that Wang Yan's current training mainly focuses on "sitting."  "She can persevere in sitting on a stool for a stretch, but not for too long." (Correspondent Wang Chunqiu)

US Supports Pakistani Government in Driving out Extremists
Staff Report, Washington, July 22 (Correspondent Xu Qisheng)
US President Bush said on the 21st that the United States will give full support to the Pakistani government in driving "al-Qaeda" and Taliban extremists away from the Pakistan-Afghanistan border area.
In his weekly routine radio address on the same day, Bush said that according to the new information of the United States, "al-Qaeda" has found a "safe haven" at the Pakistan-Afghanistan border area for hiding.
He expressed "a lot of concern" over this.
Bush said that the United States will continue to support Pakistani President Musharraf, and he believes Musharraf will persist in his fight against "al-Qaeda" and Taliban militants.
The National Intelligence Estimate report published by the United States recently said that Muslim militant groups, especially Bin Laden's "al-Qaeda," are still a continuous threat to the United States.
The agreement reached in September last year between Musharraf and some tribe leaders in the northern districts of Pakistan on preventing activities of Taliban's remaining power and "al-Qaeda" members did not achieve its anticipated effect.
These tribe leaders "are not willing or have no ability" to protect their districts' safety on their own.
In this pre-recorded address, Bush said Musharraf is currently taking active steps in correcting this mistake.

Weather Changes Cause Alps Glaciers to Shrink Rapidly
Staff Report, Geneva, July 29 (Correspondent Liu Jun)
From their long-term trace study, glacier experts from Swiss Academy of Sciences found that more than 1800 Swiss glaciers were shrinking at a speed of 3% every year on average between 1850 and 2005.
The heat wave in 2003 alone melted 1.8% of the Alps glaciers.
Experts believe that by 2100, glaciers will shrink by 80% compared to now if the global temperature goes up by 3 degrees Celsius; all glaciers will dissolve if it goes up by 5 degrees Celsius.
The Aletsch glacier is Europe's longest glacier, and was named a UNESCO Natural World Heritage Site.  However, it shrunk 100 meters within one year between 2005 and 2006.  It has come to a stage where the natural environment must be protected right away.
The picture shows the 23-kilometer Aletsch glacier.

Russian Security Bureau Charges Exiled Oligarch Berezovksy with "Secretly Initiating a Political Coup"
On July 2, Borovkov, lawyer of the Russian oligarch Berezovsky exiled in London, announced that the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation has made a new formal charge accusing his client Berezovksky of "secretly planning a national political coup and attempting to violently take over Russian political authority. "
Borovkov pointed out that in April this year, in an interview with a reporter from the British The Guardian, Berezovsky announced that he was prepared to initiate a "palace revolution" in Russia and confirmed that he provided financial support to the right wing elite representatives opposing the policies of the party in power.
Following this, the Investigation Office of the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation launched a criminal investigation against Berezovsky according to article 278 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation,"seizing power through violence."  In the last few days they formally lodged a corresponding indictment with Moscow's Savyolovsky court.
Reports say that in February 2006 the Russian Federation Chief Prosecutors Office issued a criminal indictment against Berezovsky on the same premise that the exiled oligarch confirmed in an interview that he planned to take over political power in Russia by force.
Since Berezovsky has continuously been exiled abroad and could not be extradited, in January 2007 the Russians temporarily terminated investigation of this case.
On July 2, Russia's Savyolovsky court commenced hearing another criminal case against the exiled oligarch.  The Russian Chief Prosecutors Office accused Berezovsky of embezzling 214000000 Rubles from Aeroflot and laundering 16000000 Rubles.  After hearing the evidence the court decided to adjourn until July 12 when they will launch a court investigation.  In the meantime, they will assign a state defense attorney to the accused.
Berezovsky believes this is all a "farce" and categorically forbids his defense attorney from taking part in the hearing.

Reports of Adverse Reaction Caused by Diabetes Drug Avandia Increase Greatly in Number
According to US media reports on the 15th, the number of reports in the USA of heart disease and other adverse reactions caused by the anti-diabetes drug Avandia has recently seen a dramatic rise.
The US Food and Drug Administration issued a safety warning in May this year suggesting that diabetes patients use Avandia cautiously, because scientists published a research report in the issue of New England Journal of Medicine published on May 21 that said this blockbuster drug will greatly increase the heart disease incidence rate and death rate of patients.
As a result, the safety of Avandia came under close scrutiny from doctors and patients.
Statistics show within around one month of issuing the safety warning, the US FDA received 357 reports of adverse reactions caused by Avandia, of those 38 were fatality reports.
Whereas in January and February this year, the FDA received only 50 and 73 reports of adverse reactions respectively.
These adverse reactions were as minor as blistering and as major as sudden cardiac death.
However, experts at the US FDA believe that now it is still early to arrive at the conclusion that Avandia is unsafe.
On July 30, the FDA will hold a hearing concerning the safety of Avandia.
Introduced to the market in 1999, Avandia is a kind of insulin sensitizer suitable for the treatment of Type II diabetes.
In the entire world there are about 6000000 diabetes patients who have taken or are taking Avandia.
Avandia's manufacturer, the British GlaxoSmithKline Company, has always considered that Avandia is safe and that for patients "the benefits are greater than the risks."
US Wants to Reopen Middle East Peace Talks

On the 17th, Bush also made separate telephone calls to Egyptian President Mubarak, King Abdullah II of Jordan, and King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia, requesting them to respond positively to this proposal by supporting President Abbas of the Palestinian National Authority through practical action and helping Palestine and Israel restore peace talks at an early date.
Abbas Says the PLO Central Committee Will Discuss the Issue of an Early Election in Palestine
President Abbas of the Palestine National Authority in Ramallah on the 18th said that the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) Central Committee opened a two-day meeting on the same day.  The meeting will discuss holding early elections for the Palestine National Authority and the Legislative Council, as well as other issues.
On the same day, Abbas met Solana, the EU's high representative in charge of foreign and security affairs, at the presidential headquarters in Ramallah.  At the joint press conference held afterwards, he said that if the PLO Central Committee makes a corresponding decision, the president will have the authority to issue a "legal and binding" order, and such an order will be issued very soon.
Meanwhile, Abbas feels satisfied regarding the relationship between the Palestine National Authority and the EU.
He said that the Palestinians welcome the EU's understanding of measures taken by the Palestinian presidential headquarters.
Abbas urged the EU to continue providing humanitarian aid to the Palestinian population in Gaza.
Solana reaffirmed the EU's support of Abbas and the Palestinian people.
He said that the four parties involved in the Middle East issue (the UN, EU, USA and Russia) will convene a meeting on the 19th to discuss the issue of restarting the Middle East peace process, and in the next few days proposals may possibly be put forward.
Solana expressed that the EU maintains a positive stance on deploying international troops to Gaza, but still must discuss it with all other parties, and particularly carry out discussions with the United Nations.

US Department of Defense Reconsiders Plan to Cut American Troops Posted in Europe
A US Department of Defense official said on the 23rd that due to the Iraq war and the change in the world situation, the U.S. Department of Defense is currently reconsidering its plan, formulated in 2002, to cut the number of US troops posted in Europe by roughly half.
US media quoted a Department of Defense official saying, because the Iraq war is still in progress and US relations with Russia and Iran have worsened, those at the leadership level of the Department of Defense questioned the viability of the plan to cut troops posted in Europe.
In 2002, the Secretary of Defense at the time, Rumsfeld, announced that before 2012 the US will cut the number of troops posted in Europe from the original 113000 people to 71000 people, in order to build a "smaller but superior" new model army.
At present, the total military strength of the US Army posted in Europe has already been reduced to 100000 people.
However, in June this year, Chief of Staff Craddock at US European Command Headquarter submitted a report to the current Secretary of Defense Gates, raising doubts about the abovementioned reduction plan.
The report said that while the military strength of US troops posted in Europe was being reduced, many of the units were rotated and transferred to fight in Iraq and Afghanistan.  This caused a shortfall in US troops posted in Europe and even made it impossible to carry out cooperation with their European allies as normal.
The report suggested terminating the plan to reduce US troops posted in Europe.
Associated experts in the United States believe that the above phenomenon indicates that the prolonged delay in resolving the Iraq war has already upset the original adjustment plan of the US troops.

Jingjiang City People's Armed Forces Department Builds Platform to Improve Quality of Their Full-time Cadres
Staff Report by Cao Jiawei and Zhu Chunbin: On June 18, in a class where Jiangsu province Jingjiang City People's Armed Forces full-time cadres assembled for training, a tutorial course on "Winning the Psychological War under Informationalized Conditions" taught by Lu Yuqing, director of the People's Armed Forces Department from Xilai town, received unanimous acclaim from participating students.
This is a new change achieved by the People's Armed Force Department of this city through giving their full-time cadre actual pressure appropriate to their positions in an effort to improve their overall quality .
At the beginning of this year, during a grassroots survey, this People's Armed Forces Department Party Committee discovered that some full-time cadres have worked for a long number of years, held too many posts concurrently and were not putting their main effort into doing People's Armed Forces work.
For this reason, they adopted centralized training, held meetings instead of lectures, relied on local party schools to perform training and other methods, and periodically carried out training for full-time cadre in an effort to solve such problems as the full-time cadres' narrow sphere of knowledge, singular professional capability, etc.
Based on core work, they boldly assigned duties and increased the pressure on People's Armed Forces full-time cadres, and through on-the-job training improved their work competence.
Meanwhile, they actively coordinated with local organization departments and jointly drew up the "People's Armed Forces Full-time Cadre Achieving Position through Competition Plan."  This clarifies the regulation that the director of the People's Armed Forces Department must enter the party committee leading group at the same grade and may not concurrently hold any other offices.
A full-time cadre rotation arrangement system was established to promptly rotate and exchange older full-time cadre unable to adapt to grassroots People's Armed Forces work, while those comrades with good overall character and strong work capabilities were given promotions and put to use.
Not long ago, Chen Yisong, the secretary in charge of the People's Armed Forces Department at New Century Shipyard Ltd., led a militia technical squad that innovated and developed an underwater vessel welding technology which made up for a deficiency in this nation.  He was given an accelerated promotion to director of the company's People's Armed Forces Department.

"Small, Scattered, Remote and Direct" Education Coordination Sections at a Second Artillery Base Begin Operations
Staff Report by Xue Bingjian and Correspondent Xu Yeqing: The phenomenon of difficult organization, few resources, and individual operation in educating the "small, scattered, remote and direct" units will become a thing of the past at a Second Artillery base.
In recent days, this reporter learned that after half a year of trials, this base issued "Methods of Implementing the 'Ideological and Political Education Syllabus'" to the grassroots levels.  A number of ideological and political education coordination sections covering all the "small, scattered, remote and direct" units at the base were officially set in operation.
To promote effective implementation of the "Ideological and Political Education Syllabus," at the beginning of the year, this base used their organizational abilities to conduct an in-depth investigation into the current situation of ideological and political education in "small, scattered, remote and direct" units at the base.  They combed through the key problems affecting and restricting education time, staff and effectiveness, and preliminarily formed this kind of new education format of coordination sections for "small, scattered, remote and direct" units.
The specific modus operandi of the coordination section is to break down unit organization boundaries, specify a brigade or regiment level unit to take the lead in a region with relatively concentrated "small, scattered, remote and direct" units in unified planning of topical education.  Units having different subordinate relationships either attend classes nearby together or hold remote discussions by way of a video system.
A combined method of giving classes in rotation and competing for posts is adopted to unify allocation of educational strength.  Educational hardware in parts of a region was used jointly; and the information, data and educational experiences of all units were shared and exchanged.  Typical reporting tours in parts of the region are periodically organized, and officers and soldiers exchange what they have learned.
Each coordination section has established a full-time education liaison and a part-time educational information collector.
On this basis, each coordination section has also set up systems to seek help on difficult problems, discuss important educational subject matters, report urgent ideological situations, and to test and appraise.
Director of the political department at the base, Zhang Shengmin, told reporters that establishing political education coordination sections has not only reduced wastage of educational resources, but has also deepened the effect of the education.
Some politics instructors were afraid to lose points in front of officers and men from other units, so they took the initiative to learn new knowledge and seek out new methods of education.
The officers and men receiving education also actively digested the educational content lest they sounded unprofessional in front of officers and men from neighboring units in their discussions and analyses.
In so doing, the enthusiasm of the educators and the educated has been both effectively stirred up.
R&amp;R Quota of a North China Sea Fleet Maintenance Battalion Allocated Entirely to Soldiers
Staff Report by Zhang Junhong and Li Hongjun: On July 17, under the leadership of Zhang Weiliang, deputy chief engineer of a North China Sea fleet maintenance battalion, the battalion's 31 soldiers working long-term on the maintenance frontline cheerfully stepped onto the R&amp;R train bound for Beidaihe.
NCO Class 6 Luo Xiangming happily told the writer: "Battalion leaders caring about and taking care of soldiers have moved us deeply.  After returning from R&amp;R, we will definitely work twice as hard!"
This is the first time this battalion has organized R&amp;R for grass- roots soldiers.
Not long ago, when battalion commander Yao Qingsheng went down to the grassroots units, he saw some soldiers in charge of maintenance work carrying out equipment repairs while braving the high temperatures; it left Yao Qingsheng profoundly moved.
"Soldiers forget about themselves when working; the party committee should care about and take care of soldiers and take responsibility for their health."  At the party committee meeting, Yao Qingsheng's words won everybody's approval.
Following research by the party committee, a decision was made to completely allocate the R&amp;R quota assigned to the battalion by their superiors to soldiers working on the maintenance frontline.
Openly Conducting Work at a Jinan Military Command Department Makes "Hot Issues" Not Hot
Staff Report
Report by Wang Weiqin and Special Correspondent Li Deying: On July 25, at a Service Support Company of Jinan Military Command, the writer saw a public notice board written on with army engineering tenders, financial expenses, cadre promotions, NCOs joining the party, and other important issues prominently hung up in a display window.
As introduced by political commissar Su Chengsen, this is a concrete action taken by this department to push forward the open office work system.
At the beginning of this year, this army party committee formulated the "Office and Grassroots Bidirectional Supervision," "Public Notices of Sensitive Issue," and other measures to strengthen the building of party conduct and clean government.  These require that important issues involving the immediate interests of officers and soldiers and army construction are only decided after listening to the opinion of grassroots officers and soldiers.  Also, depending upon the situation, the entire process of office standards, procedures, results, etc. are made public.
The army set up a suggestion box and notice board, opened up a "message board" on their Intranet and extensively collected everybody's opinions and suggestions.
At the beginning of the year, the soldier's dormitory refurbishment project started.  Before work got underway, the party committee extensively solicited opinion from officers and soldiers, and then issued a public tender notice and carried out public tender bidding.
This both saved expenditures and won the support of officers and soldiers.
Conducting work openly and fairly has spurred a good atmosphere to take shape at the grassroots level.
In this army, whether it is settling upon work as large as 'hot issue' sensitive affairs or as small as taking personal vacation time to visit one's relatives, the everyday expenditure on mess accounts and other items, the grassroots company persists with scheduled public notices and publications, and take the initiative to accept mass supervision.
Thirteen Pilots Resign, China Eastern Wuhan Company Counter Sues for over One Hundred Million Yuan in Compensation
Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, July 11 (Correspondents Liu Yang and Pi Shuchu)
Thirteen pilots submitted their resignation, and "the boss," China Eastern Airlines Wuhan Limited Liability Company, wrote out a compensation sheet for as high as the massive amount of 105000000.  Up until now, this is a labor dispute case which involves Hubei province's largest compensation amount.
The Hubei Province Labor Dispute Arbitration Committee is currently examining this case.
In May this year, 13 pilots at China Eastern Wuhan Company successively submitted their resignation and were refused by the company.
Subsequently, in the beginning of June, the pilots one by one submitted labor arbitration applications to the Hubei Province Labor Dispute Arbitration Committee, petitioning for an arbitration decision to terminate their working relationship with China Eastern Wuhan Company.
After China Eastern Wuhan Company received the notice to respond to the lawsuit, they submitted a countersuit demanding the 13 pilots to separately pay them varying consequential damages of over 6000000 to over 10000000 yuan, in a total of 105000000 yuan, for dissolving the employment contract in breach of employment contract stipulations.
To our understanding, the pilots signed an open-ended employment contract with China Eastern and, unless termination conditions or dissolution conditions stipulated in the employment contract appear, the legal force of the employment contract will continue until the pilot's legal retirement age.
The Hubei Province Labor Dispute Arbitration Committee will examine and handle the suit and countersuit in this case together, and hopes to conclude proceedings before August 8.
(International) North and South Korea to Hold Sixth General-level Talks
Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 16 (Correspondents Gao Haorong and Xia Yu)
Military representatives from North Korea and South Korea held working-level military contact talks in Panmunjom on the 16th.  Both parties agreed to hold their sixth general-level talks from the 24th to the 26th.
According to a Korean Central News Agency report, among the contact that day,  North Korean military representative and senior colonel of the People's Army Pak Rim Su submitted a proposal to set up a common fishing zone between Yeonpyeong Island and Baengnyeong Island in North Korea's western sea region and explained its reasoning in detail.
He said that, when setting up a common fishing zone, one must implement such principles as striving for the greatest common economic profit and benefit for all the people and ensuring the peace and stability of fishing operations.
When speaking about the maritime boundary issue which is an existing dispute between both parties, Pak Rim Su said for both parties to prevent the occurrence of military conflict in the western sea region, both parties should give up the maritime boundary each has persisted with and mutually acknowledge and respect territorial sea rights, and should take the related agreements between North and South Korea, the North and South Korea Cease-fire Agreement and internationally-recognized law as a basis for negotiation.
He expressed that the prompt formulation of military safeguard measures to move ahead with North-South cooperative exchange is the "position always maintained" by the North Korean military.
He said that the South Korean side should currently take military measures to ensure North Korea's civilian shipping can go from Haeju Port directly to the south and freely transit the Cheju Strait.
This is the second working-level military contact talks held by the two parties, North and South Korea, since the tenth of this month.
The Fifth North and South Korea general-level talks were held from May 8 to 11 at the "Unity Pavilion" at Panmunjeom on the North Korean side.
(Sports) Cuba Complains Boxing Ring Ropes Too Short
Xinhua News Agency, Rio de Janeiro, July 21 (Correspondents Chen Weihua and Leng Tong)
A Cuban delegation complained on the 21st that the boxing ring ropes in the Pan American Games this time are too short and will affect the performance standard of the boxers.
According to International Boxing Federation rules, during international matches, boxing ring ropes should be 6.1 meters long, but based on measurements by the Cuban delegation boxing team coach, Pedro Roque, the length of boxing ring ropes in the Pan American Games this time is more than one meter shorter than standard.
Roque said, "We submitted an official protest because this matter does not just affect one country, Cuba, but involves everybody.
Ropes that are too short will affect the boxers' dodging movements."
He also jokingly said, "If they cannot find ropes complying with Olympic standards in Rio, they can search elsewhere.
If we had known earlier, we would have brought some from Cuba."
That day, Mexican and Columbian delegations also expressed dissatisfaction at the length of the boxing ring ropes.
Although Columbian boxer Julio Deibis triumphed in his first fight, he said, "Although I won my first match, the boxing ring was too narrow, and it really made me feel uncomfortable."
White House Urges Hastily Sending Nuclear Inspectors to Supervise North Korea's Nuclear Reactor Shutdown
The White House called for nuclear inspectors to be hastily sent to supervise North Korea's nuclear reactor shutdown; the White House made this appeal after a telephone conversation between US President Bush and South Korean President Roh Moo Hyun.
White House National Security Council spokesperson Johndroe said that today the two leaders "discussed recent developments in cooperation by the US and South Korea on the North Korean nuclear issue, and that they hope IAEA inspectors will return to North Korea very soon to supervise the North Korea nuclear reactor halt and shutdown."
Johndroe pointed out that both presidents also welcomed the US-South Korea free trade agreement signed +yesterday, and will work towards ensuring approval of this agreement by both countries' legislatures.
Experts believe that the plutonium produced by Pyongyang in the last 20 years is enough to manufacture 12 nuclear weapons.
After his visit to Pyongyang last week, US special envoy to the six-party talks Hill said he anticipated the nuclear reactors in Yongbyon would be shut down in the middle of July.
43 People Killed in Disastrous Torrential Rain in Western India
Western India was attacked by storms and heavy rain over the weekend.  Some areas were seriously flooded, and all domestic and international flights for the major western city of Mumbai came to a halt.
A rescue official said today that a total of 43 deaths resulted.
Between June and September every year, strong winds and heavy rain brought by monsoons often cause India, a country with a population of 1100000000, to flood disastrously, even causing injuries and death.
In this torrential rain disaster, half of the victims were swept away and drowned in floods; others were killed due to collapsed houses or electrocution from power line short-circuits.
Mumbai, the financial hub of India, was also affected.
Rainfall in Mumbai reached 243mm in just two days, the 29th and the 30th.
Mumbai's civic chief Pathak said that the city alone had a death toll of 13.
City government officials appealed to the 15000000 city residents to maintain their safety by not going out until the torrential rain lets up somewhat.
The rain stopped briefly yesterday, but most districts in Mumbai are still flooded today.
Satellite Images Show Iran Digging Tunnels; Possibly to Protect Nuclear Equipment
The Institute for Science and International Security, a US think tank, reported today that commercial satellite images show Iran currently tunneling at a mountain near the Natanz uranium enrichment facility, possibly to protect nuclear equipment during an aerial attack.
These images were taken by US Digital Globe Corporation (DigitalGlobe) on June 11 and published on the website of the Research Institute for Science and International Security.
The research institute, a non-profit research group, is located in Washington.
The images show road construction along a mountain just 2.4 kilometers south of the Natanz facility.  Meanwhile, inside the facility is a uranium enrichment plant.
Analysts Albright and Brannan noted in a report, "the tunnel entrances and exits in the images" are not clear, but that "one of the roads appears to lead into a tunnel facility, and another road might also lead to tunnel entrances and exits."
They said, "Such tunnel installations dug into a mountain would bring excellent protection during an aerial attack."
WTO Representatives Raise New Proposals; Hope of Breaking Stalemate in the Doha Round of Talks
With the hope of breaking the stalemate in the Doha Round of trade talks, key WTO negotiation representatives today proposed a large cut in farm subsidies by the US and a sharp reduction in industrial product import tariffs by developing countries.
An official said that the new "draft model" demands that the US reduce its annual farm subsidies from the current allowed amount of US $ 19000000000 to US $ 16200000000, and for developing countries to adjust industrial product import tariffs down to less than 23%.
These proposals aim to break the almost six years of stalemate in the Doha Round of talks, and to help the 150 WTO members come to a compromise agreement.
WTO Secretary Lamy called these proposals "a fair and reasonable foundation for concluding a balanced and development-oriented agreement that has ambitious goals."
Lamy said, "Member countries will not be completely satisfied with the content of the proposals, but currently there are fewer problems concerning differences than problems creating consensus."
He called for intensive talks to be held in the next few weeks.
Hostage Crisis Countdown; South Korea and Taliban Negotiate Directly
The Afghani Taliban have kidnapped 23 South Korean hostages and set as a final deadline sunset today, demanding that South Korea withdraw its troops from Afghanistan, or they will kill the hostages.
With minutes and seconds going by, the situation saw a positive development with South Korean officials launching talks with the Taliban today for the first time.
Yet at the same time, the Taliban said that a German who had also been kidnapped was very weak physically, had started slipping into a coma, and had lost consciousness.
The Taliban calls for Germany and South Korea to withdraw their troops from Afghanistan, and demands 33 guerrillas imprisoned by the Afghan government in exchange for these hostages.
Taliban spokesperson Ahmadi said in a telephone interview with AFP from an unknown location, "We have come in direct contact with the South Korean representatives through tribal elders."
"We hope the talks this time will achieve results," said Ahmadi.
The Taliban set as a final deadline nightfall, local time (10:30pm Taiwan time), at which point they will start killing the South Korean hostages.
The guerrillas have already extended their deadline twice.
Consensus on Sea Conflict Tough to Reach; Military Talks between Two Koreas End on Bad Terms
The three-day high-level military talks between the two Koreas, South Korea and North Korea, ended on bad terms today, as a result of each side sticking to its own views regarding marking the sea border.
The talks, held in the border city of Panmunjom, today entered the last day on the agenda.  North Korea's chief delegate Lieutenant General Kim Yong-chol (transliterated) said, "We concluded that we no longer need these fruitless talks."
Kim Yong-chol, obviously displeased with a flushed face, attacked South Korea for deliberately avoiding the discussion of drawing a new sea border to replace the existing "Northern Limit Line."
He pointed out that the "Northern Limit Line" is not legitimate.
Located in the Yellow Sea, the "Northern Limit Line" was drawn by the US military in 1953 when the Korean War ended.  However, it has become a focus of dispute between the two Koreas in recent years, with North Korea even unwilling to recognize it.
North Korea said that South Korea's warships have entered its territorial waters illegally, triggering a tense situation; South Korea claimed this accusation to be groundless.
A conflict broke out in the local waters in June 1999, causing dozens of North Korean crew members to lose their lives.
A similar clash occurred again in June 2002, with six South Koreans sadly killed.
US Treasury Secretary Arrives in China for Visit; Environmental Protection and Exchange Rate are Main Points of Concern
US Treasury Secretary Paulson arrived in China yesterday for a visit.  The US is currently making full efforts to convince China to further implement necessary economic reforms and environmental protection work, in particular the Renminbi exchange rate issue that has received a lot of attention.
A US diplomat said that Paulson first went to visit Xining city, capital of Qinghai, a large province in northwest China.
China is currently implementing a series of environmental protection programs near the largest salt-water lake in Qinghai.
Paulson moved on to Beijing today, discussing with Chinese leading officials such topics as advancing the course of the "US-China Strategic Economic Dialogue" launched last year.
The "US-China Strategic Economic Dialogue" mainly discusses topics such as the economy and environmental protection, though most important is the Renminbi exchange rate issue.  US congressional representatives think that the Renminbi is excessively undervalued.
The US-China trade deficit is currently seeing a rapid, sharp increase.  Pressure in the US is gradually increasing, with congressional representatives ready to take retaliatory action to oppose their so-called unfair trade policies of China.
Last week, the US Senate Finance Committee passed a motion by an overwhelming vote requesting the Treasury Department to identify a list of countries whose exchange rate is in "fundamental misalignment," opening the door to potentially imposing economic sanctions against Beijing.
US congressional representatives say that the undervalued Renminbi makes goods sold from China to the US very cheap, aggravating the US-China trade imbalance.  The US trade deficit with China last year reached US $ 232500000000.
Mourinho Claims He Will Stay at Chelsea and Leave Soccer World Completely Before Age 60
Since the beginning of the season, Mourinho's future at Chelsea has been a hot topic for the media.  However, as before, the Portuguese once again stressed that he will definitely stay in west London this summer.
"Some newspapers listed 14 new candidates to lead Chelsea, but I am going to stay at Chelsea," said Mourinho with sarcasm.
Mourinho reiterated that one day he hopes he can become coach of the Portuguese team.  "I really want very much to coach the national team.  I believe there will be a day when the Portuguese Football Federation also hopes very much to engage me as the leader of the national team."
However, the 44-year-old Mourinho does not plan to devote his whole life to soccer.  He said he would retire before 60 years old, that he does not want to work until 70 years old like Bobby Robson and Sir Ferguson.
"I have promised my wife that I will not be like Robson and Ferguson, who kept coaching until 70 years old."
Mourinho said frankly, "I want to leave the soccer world completely when I reach 60.
I have too many things which I cannot do now waiting for me to do."
"I do not want to become a soccer consultant or technical director like Valdano or Sagi.
I do not want to play this kind of role.
I do not want to become the president of a club.  I just want to say goodbye to soccer completely," stressed Mourinho.

F1 "Spy Case" Hearing Concluded Yesterday; McLaren Temporarily Escapes Punishment
A special hearing called by the FIA World Motor Sport Council for the Ferrari technology spy case came to a close in Paris yesterday evening, Beijing time.  The McLaren team that had been summoned escaped suffering: the council decided not to penalize McLaren for the time being.
After the hearing, the official FIA website issued a statement saying, "The Vodafone McLaren Mercedes team was in possession of confidential Ferrari information, but there is currently insufficient evidence to prove that this information was improperly used for the FIA Formula One World Championship.  We'll therefore impose no penalty."
However, the Ferrari technology spy case does not end with this.
In this decision, the World Motor Sport Council also said, "If it is found in the future that relevant Ferrari information has been used to the detriment of the championship, we reserve the right to call McLaren back to a World Motor Sport Council hearing, where they could face punishment of disqualification from not only the 2007 season, but also the 2008 season."
Former McLaren chief designer Mike Coughlan, who is now suspended, was found with almost 800 pages of Ferrari technology documents containing a series of links to Ferrari's 2007 race cars, including design, power, construction, inspection, testing, development, and operation.
McLaren insists that no other people on the team knew about this information before Coughlan was suspended, and that McLaren's race cars this season have no Ferrari elements.

Experts Believe: QDII Insurers Will Not Divert Domestic Stock Market Capital in Near Future
Chinanews.com, July 30
According to a China Securities Journal report, with the introduction of the Provisional Measures for Administration of Outbound Investment of Insurance Funds a few days ago, insurance funds have more space to utilize the capital markets.
Liu Lefei, chief investment officer of China Life Insurance Co. Ltd., believes that with Renminbi appreciation and positive trends in domestic capital markets, insurance institutions in the near future will not make large-scale overseas investments with foreign exchange purchases.  This also indicates that QDII insurers will not divert domestic stock market capital in the near future.
The report said that many insurance institutions share the same view.
Experts believe that as there is currently no market for Renminbi derivatives, insurance institutions have insufficient means of avoiding risk.  As a result, it is not time yet for large-scale foreign exchange purchases.
Liu Lefei said that in terms of capital allocation, outbound investment should make up a certain ratio of overall allocations for insurance companies in the long run.
However, in view of relatively strong pressure for Renminbi appreciation at present, China Life will mainly use its own foreign exchange funds for outbound investments.
Foreign exchange purchases for outbound investment should be handled carefully under the current situation.

Bian Implicitly Criticizes Judicial Interference in Election; "Judicial Yuan" Denies, and Demands Explanation
Chinanews.com, July 31 - On the 30th, Chen Shuibian questioned an attempt by the island's judicial personnel to interfere with the election of the Taiwan region's leaders.
Taiwan's "Department of Judicial Administration Director-General" Kao Chin-chih said on the same day that the current performance of the island's judges does not match what Chen Shuibian said, and requested that Chen Shuibian explain what he said.
According to a report from Taiwan's United Daily News, on the 30th Chen Shuibian questioned interference, influence, and even attempts to control the election activities of the various parties' candidates, due to political factors or election considerations, by judges, public prosecutors, or investigators.  He claimed he hopes that this phenomenon does not exist in Taiwan, but that it might be very difficult.
In response to Chen Shuibian's questioning, Taiwanese "Judicial Yuan President" Weng Yueh-sheng kept a low profile and did not respond.  "Secretary-General" Fan Kuang-chun, on the other hand, assigned Kao Chin-chih to speak on behalf of the "Judicial Yuan."
Kao Chin-chih said that both the Taiwanese constitution and the "Judges' Rules" proclaim in writing that judges must be nonpartisan, cannot participate in political party activities, and cannot assist in elections; judges abide by the relevant restrictions very carefully.  The "Judicial Yuan" believes the judges are all doing a good job.
Kao Chin-chih gave an example, noting that Judge Jang Shenq-shii of Kaohsiung "Branch High Court" participated a few years ago in a course conducted by the Ketagalan School, and was punished because the course was tainted by a political party.  The punishment resolution was by a self-disciplinary committee composed of judges.
Jang Shenq-shii once wanted to take part in DPP primary elections, and eventually decided to give up because there was controversy over his election participation while working.
Kao Chin-chih thinks that if the ruling of an individual case can be appealed to a higher court for relief, it cannot be inferred that a judge has political motives based only on whether the ruling is a win or a loss.
Don't Believe Blindly in the "Theoretical Field" of Law
Clause 8 of the revised draft of the Law on Lawyers, which was recently submitted to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress for review, states: Those who have undertaken specialized work such as legal research or teaching and had a high-level title or the equivalent, upon application to become a lawyer can be allowed to practice law after examination and verification by the State Council's judicial administrative department.
(June 28, China Youth Daily)
In law, there is the "theoretical field" and the "practical field."  The former mainly includes "abstract actions" such as legal teaching and research work, while the latter undertakes more "concrete actions" such as litigation, legal consultation, and legal services.
For a long time, "intellectual disparagement" has existed between the "theoretical field" and "practical field" of law.  The "theoretical field" thinks that the "practical field" lacks necessary accomplishment in the law and are only mechanical "legalists"; meanwhile, the response of the "practical field" to criticism by the "theoretical field" is "theory cannot guide practice."
Concerning this kind of division of labor gap, what the law can do is stay neutral instead of giving strong support to either side.
However, the "specially licensed lawyer system" in the Law on Lawyers objectively recognizes a judgment that the law's "theoretical field" is above the law's "practical field."
The fact is that some experts and scholars who are engaged in researching and teaching of pure legal theory, such as history of the legal system and international law, do not fit with practical law regardless of their depth of theoretical attainment.
In this way, for the law's "practical field," the "specially licensed lawyer system" no doubt opens a "bad door" which very negatively influences chaos in qualifications.
This is not the only blind belief about the "theoretical field."  The phenomenon of expert opinions and expert panel discussions frequently influencing and even overruling court rulings is another direct manifestation of this kind of blind belief.
Encouraging Chinese-funded Vessels to Sail Flying the Red Five-Star Flag
Staff report, Correspondent Feng Lei
It was learned from a press conference held by the State Council Information Office that starting from July 1 this year, China will implement the Special Registration Policy on Tax Exemption for China Funded International Forwarding Vessels, to encourage Chinese-funded vessels flying foreign flags to repatriate for registration, to obtain People's Republic of China nationality, and sail flying the red five-star flag.
To further promote the healthy development of our country's ocean shipping industry and to expand the national steamship fleet, the Ministry of Communications, targeting relevant issues triggered by overseas registration and flying of foreign flags by quite a number of vessels among our country's international shipping vessels, recently promulgated the Announcement on the Special Registration Policy on Tax Exemption for China Funded International Forwarding Vessels, clarifying the conditions and application procedures for enjoying special tax exemption policies.  Starting July 1 this year, vessels meeting the conditions, and that apply to conduct customs import declarations within two years, are exempted from customs duties and value-added tax on imports.
Vessels that apply can choose Shanghai, Tianjin, and Dalian as their port of registry for arranging vessel registration.
Britain Lowers Terrorist Attack Threat Level
Staff Report, London, July 5 (Correspondent Guo Lin)
The British government lowered its terrorist attack threat level from the highest to "severe" on the 4th, meaning there will not be a terrorist attack in Britain soon but an attack is still "highly possible."
Currently, the British police is turning its investigation scope on India and Australia.
As the eight terrorist attack suspects arrested all worked in the medical system, the government will carry out emergency checks on the background of foreign immigrants who work in the medical system.
According to the information, nearly 90000 people working in the British public medical system all obtained their medical qualifications overseas.
Prime Minister Brown also requested investigations on the background of high-tech immigration applicants, and employers or relevant organizations will be asked to provide background information of the applicants.
Do Not Let Peddlers Spoil Public Places
When out on a trip, one wants to feel relaxed, refreshed, and free, enjoying to the utmost the fruits of natural scenery and society's civilization.
However, many people encounter this kind of vexation when traveling domestically: being chased and intercepted by peddlers and middlemen in public places.
Whether on autos or trains, boarding or alighting, there are constant entanglements with small peddlers and some unlicensed middlemen.
If they are not selling eggs, peanuts, or sesame seed cakes, they are selling newspapers and magazines.  There are also many unlicensed middlemen introducing restaurants and hotels, even peddling fake certificates and fake receipts, among other things.
If you do not accept, he can chase you for a few hundred meters, like someone ready to die for a just cause in the face of failure.
At some scenic spots, many tourists also have the same feeling.
Prior to entering the main gate, people come to peddle things like travel souvenirs and small crafts.
After entering, there is more of this kind of situation.  No matter how good your mood, you will be bothered to the point of losing interest.
Media have reported that many foreign tourists in Xi'an sing endless praise for the scenic spots and historic sites of Xi'an, but cannot understand why masses of small peddlers and hawkers are allowed to sell everywhere.
Public places including bus stations and scenic spots are at root places for trips and relaxation.  They should be civilized, orderly, quiet, harmonious, providing tourists a comfortable and relaxed environment.
Peddlers' freedom to come and go not only affects the mood of tourists, it also destroys the public order of these public places on an objective level, bringing about visual pollution and environmental pollution.  At the same time, it also gives lawless people the condition and opportunity for creating trouble.
The important thing is, these public places are windows onto the development of local spiritual civilization.  One can deduce much from little information.  It is not only the image that suffers, as local economic development will be influenced as well.
Just think, you want to make the tourism industry bigger and stronger, but use this kind of chaotic tourism environment to welcome guests from near and far.  Who still wants to come?  Who dares to come?
How can your tourism economy obtain beneficial results?
With the coming of the peak travel season, it should be said that creating a civilized travel environment for tourists from near and far is an urgent matter.
Public places are not markets.  The operating behavior of small peddlers and hawkers should be standardized.  Put a firm stop to unlicensed operations, staunchly crack down on illegal activities.
Only a civilized and orderly environment can let tourists come happily, leave satisfied, and return with excitement.
In short, do not let peddlers spoil public places.
"Rewarding Self-Initiated Exit from Subsistence Allowances" Does not Pass Muster
The Jianguomen neighborhood in Dongcheng District, Beijing, gave items such as refrigerators as a reward to 12 poor families who exited from subsistence allowances on their own initiative.
(Beijing News, July 10)
This writer feels happy for the improved lives of these families, but has mixed feelings about the phrase "self-initiated exit from subsistence allowances," and the practice of "giving rewards."
An assistant director of the Jianguomen neighborhood said, "In light of problems like cheating on subsistence allowances, encouraging the self-initiated exit from subsistence allowances sets an example for other poor families."
This example is indeed worth promoting if it encourages other poor people to get out of their predicaments through one's own hard work; it is really somewhat naïve if it is thought this will "inspire" those people who have fraudulently received subsistence allowances for a long time.
When differentiating and straightening out real and fake poor families, what should be relied on more is the law.
Relevant departments should strengthen the obligations that must be met for poor families to enjoy subsistence allowances: such as immediately reporting changes in family members' incomes, reporting employment situation, and accepting regular reviews.  Meanwhile, relevant departments should increase the strength of supervision and investigation.
In the end, "exit from subsistence allowance according to the law" is the long-term solution.
Who pays when the neighborhood gives material rewards to families who exit from subsistence allowance?
As a first-level governmental organization, a neighborhood has its expenses covered by financial allocations.
However, should this taxpayer money be spent?
On the one hand, families who exit from subsistence allowances prove that they already have a certain "self-sufficient" capacity; on the other hand, aren't there still people who are applying for subsistence allowances?
Government financial allocations, which is called a lifeline, should provide timely help rather than reward good fortune.
Liu Gangyi Willing to be a Service Provider; This is a More Convincing Statement
On July 10, Chengdu City Xindu District Mulan Town Party Committee Secretary Liu Gangyi, the first town party committee secretary in the country to be directly elected by the public, received his fourth review since taking office, achieving a satisfaction rate of 97%.
Liu Gangyi positioned himself as a "service provider" during a conversation between this correspondent and Liu Gangyi.
(Yesterday, Beijing News)
"Service provider" in the words of Liu Gangyi may be more real, more convincing than "service provider" in the words of some appointed cadres.
The biggest advantage of being directly elected by the public compared to appointment is that for the former, determination of power mainly originates with ordinary party members and the public, whereas for the latter, nominations are mainly by superior organizations.  Therefore, direction of the power source determines that with the former, responsibility to the public must be given top priority.
The source of power, and to whom one owes responsibility, are basic elements that determine how elected people carry out their work.
Some people question whether such "democratic review" is more like a "democracy show."
My opinion is, having this kind of "democratic review" format is better than nothing.
Considering the history and current situation of China's grassroots democratic political development, I think direct election by the public is already a major breakthrough.  Democratic review is an important component of this pioneering work, and should not be underestimated in promoting grassroots democratic political development.
Optimism in India for Electing First Female President; Analysts Claim Relatively High Possibility of Election Victory; Female Voters Hope This Improves Status of Women
On June 23, Patil clasped her hands together before filling out the presidential candidate documents.
India's presidential election kicked off on the 19th, with the new president to be elected from between Shekhawat, the current vice president, and Pratibha Patil, the recently resigned governor of Rajasthan state.
Patil is the first female presidential candidate in the history of India.  If she is elected, she will become the first female president in India's history.
Patil is the presidential candidate for the governing Congress Party, whereas Shekhawat comes from the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party.
Since the Congress Party has an advantage in the presidential electoral college, the media and public largely guess that the possibility of a Patil victory is higher.
Patil, who is 72 years old this year, was Rajasthan's female governor.
She started out as a lawyer, entering parliament in 1985.  With abundant political work experience, she received high opinions from the government when governor of Rajasthan.
She has also dedicated herself for social welfare, as honorary chairwoman for many cultural, educational, and social welfare organizations.
Analysts note that Patil became a candidate as a result of her unswerving loyalty to Sonia Ghandi, president of India's Congress Party.
In India, the Ghandi family has been controlling the governing Congress Party for a long time.
Patil has received many female voters' support.  Female voters believe that in India where there is a strong concept of discrimination against women, Patil will remold the image of women and raise the status of women.
The constitution stipulates that the president of India, a federal country, is the country's leader and commander-in-chief of the armed forces in name, without representing any party or organization.  It is more of a symbol.

135 Positions of Responsibility in Guangxi Placed under Administrative Efficiency Supervision, 619 People Held Accountable
From this year, every department in each region of Guangxi has launched a campaign to change the working style of cadres and intensify construction of administrative efficiency in its organizations.  It implements "three systems:" the initial enquiry responsibility system, the handling formalities within time limits system, and the responsibility accountability system.  The key examination and approval departments affiliated to 33 autonomous regions and 135 positions of responsibility were brought into the administrative efficiency supervision work network.
Up until now, 619 people have been called to account.
On the 5th, this correspondent learned from the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Committee for Discipline Inspection that at present Guangxi has preliminarily formed a three tier, autonomous region, municipal and county administrative efficiency inspection work network to intensify supervision of the key departments and positions of responsibility.  An electronic monitoring system of 14 cities has been fully implemented in the autonomous region's network.
The autonomous region administrative efficiency electronic inspection system connects directly to the key examination and approval departments affiliated to 33 autonomous regions and 135 positions of responsibility that deal with the investment environment and the life and work of the people.  This has further standardized the conducting of examinations and approvals, as well as improved its efficiency.
At the same time, all levels of discipline inspection and monitoring organizations in Guangxi are strictly investigating and dealing with cases involving work style and efficiency, and damage to the public interest.  Up until now, a total of 1104 cases have been verified and investigation results for 769 cases have been finalized; 584 work units and 619 people have been called to account.
Member of the standing committee of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Party Committee and Discipline Inspection Committee Secretary Ma Tieshan said on the 5th that administrative efficiency inspection is an item of work that will always remain concomitant with administrative activities and must be progressively formed into a longstanding and effective mechanism.
Guangxi must further perfect and standardize codes of practice for each item of administrative management, build a complete administrative efficiency monitoring work system and safeguarding mechanism, and bring efficiency monitoring on track of systemization and standardization.  It must further regulate monitoring and inspection procedures, build a complete complaint handling and performance efficiency evaluation and assessment mechanism, and significantly increase accountability efforts by using a strict accountability system to ensure that the initial enquiry responsibility system, the handling formalities within time limits system and other work systems are put fully into practice.

Two Jordanians Sentenced for Plotting to Attack Americans
Two Jordanian men were sentenced by the Jordan State Security Court on the 11th for plotting an attack on Americans in Jordan.
Both of them are 25 year old men, one named Sameeh al-Hotari was sentenced to eight years imprisonment and forced labor, the other named Mohammed Shehada was sentenced to three years imprisonment and forced labor.
Court officials said that al-Hotari was also charged with illegally possessing a firearm.  Police discovered a submachine gun when searching his home.
The court originally decided to sentence al-Hotari to life imprisonment but later reconsidered to give him the opportunity for a "fresh start" and reduced the sentence to eight years.
The indictment said that after the Iraq war broke out, the two accused decided they must avenge the Muslims who "suffered from being humiliated by Americans," so they plotted an attack on Americans living in Jordan.
In August 2006 they locked onto an American living in the suburbs of the Jordanian capital Amman.  However, they were arrested by police before carrying out the attack on him.
The identity of this American was not published in the indictment.
The indictment also charged the two accused with planning to attack other Americans but did not reveal specific details.

07 Style Uniform Designers Visit PLA Daily.com
Staff Report, Beijing, July 13 - Report by Yang Baojin and Correspondent Liu Xinxin: Starting on August 1, every army in the entire armed forces will successively change to wearing the 07 style uniform.
This evening, the pladaily.com specially invited Chen Jun, deputy director of the Army General Logistics Military Supplies and Fuels Department Clothing and Equipment Office, and Su Yang, senior engineer at the Army General Logistics Department Military Supplies Equipment Research Institute and one of the designers of the 07 style uniform, to visit pladaily.com and chat with net friends inside and outside the army about the background, research and development process behind the birth of the new uniform, drumming up a response among netizens.
Two honored guests were directly involved in the design, research and development of the 07 style uniform.
When speaking of changes to the new uniform, they introduced by saying that the 07 style uniform was designed based on all previous uniform design changes, especially the 97 style uniform, and that as many as several hundred improvements were made in seven areas, including army uniform series, manufacture, style and so on.
The biggest feature of the 07 style uniform is that it embodies the requirements of serialization, functionality and humanization, making our army's uniform achieve, for the first time, a standard for the three armies that is coordinated, has a complete variety, and whose series match.  It symbolizes that the construction standard of our army uniform has achieved a historic breakthrough.
The two honored guests also exchanged opinions with net friends at length about the new uniform's variety, style, models, decoration and other issues.
This interview was hosted jointly by pladaily.com, China.com, sina.com and TOM.com.
If You Start Well, You Should Finish Well
Simply speaking from the match result, a 2-2 score is reasonable and is also acceptable to the Chinese team.  The key is that the match itself left people feeling somewhat disappointed.
If Iran was in the lead 2-0 and then China came back to even the score, the impression given to Chinese fans would definitely be different and morale would have lifted a lot.  What a pity that the situation was exactly the opposite.
One could say that starting well and being unable to finish well is an old problem for the Chinese team.
The Chinese team often plays poor soccer when their situation is extremely favorable, and the view of the average person is that the Chinese players are mentally not strong enough.
Indeed, this is one of the reasons China is incapable of "finishing well."
However, looking at China's match tonight, this does not necessarily seem to be the case.
Not mentioning Sun Jihai, Sun Xiang, Shao Jiayi, Zhen Zhi and others who played soccer in Europe before, Li Weifeng and others are also old war veterans.  They have extensive experience and, logically speaking, should not have any problems pschologically.
Regretfully, this Chinese team was held to a draw by Iran, and I am afraid that the reason was ineffective deployment of troops in the course of a battle.
While lagging behind, Iran substituted two people, and the scene immediately improved.
China also substituted three players in the second half, but the result was not good.
To overcome the old problem of starting well and being unable to finish well, they must correctly determine the source of the problem.
As long as the problem can be correctly determined, it should not be hard to find a way to remove the problem.
What they really should fear is acting blindly out of desperation.
If they continue this way, no matter how many matches the Chinese team play, they will continue to repeat their old problem.  This is a far cry from everyone's expectation to see them improve with each match they play.
(International) Research Indicates Atrial Fibrillation Relates to Mutation in Two Types of Gene
Xinhua News Agency, London, July 2 - Icelandic scientists discovered through research that people with mutation in two types of gene in the body have a far greater risk of getting afflicted with atrial fibrillation than the average person.
According to a report in the latest issue of Nature magazine, after screening the genes of several thousand people from Iceland, Sweden, the US, and the Hong Kong region of China, researchers at Iceland's deCODE Genetics Company made the above discovery.
These two types of gene discovered by scientists are located near that of a type of gene that plays an important role in the early stages of heart development.
AF, i.e. atrial fibrillation, is clinically one of the most commonly seen cardiac arrhythmias and can give rise to heart palpitations, shortness of breath, tiredness and sudden stroke.
In addition, according to a report in Nature Genetics magazine published on the 1st, researchers at deCODE Genetics Company also discovered two types of gene on human chromosome 17 correlating to prostate cancer morbidity.  They exert some kind of effect in more than one third of prostate cancer cases.
Research also discovered that while increasing the risk of people getting afflicted with prostate cancer, one of the genes also decreases the risk of getting afflicted with Type II diabetes.
(Sports) US Veteran Goalkeeper Keller May Retire after America Cup
Xinhua News Agency, Maracaibo (Venezuela), July 3 (Correspondent Liu Jian)
According to a Venezuelan media report on the third, US team's 37-year-old veteran goalkeeper Keller said in an interview here that if he is unable to find a suitable club to serve after the America Cup, then he will choose retirement.
"If I am still unable to obtain a one to two season contract in a high level league team four to six weeks after the America Cup ends, then perhaps retirement is not a bad option for me."
With Munchen-Gladbach falling to the German Bundesliga 2, Keller also left this team which he served for more than two seasons.
Although Keller is considering turning in his gloves, he obviously has more than enough suitors who are interested in him.  He spoke candidly that at present, as many as eight teams are interested in inviting him to join them,
yet this veteran goalkeeping idol, who has served in the Spanish Primera League, the English Premier Division, and German Bundesliga 1, expressed that how he finally decides, depends upon his family, "My child is already 9 years old, he has stayed with me in three different countries and gone to three different schools.  My choice now must consider how to better benefit my family."
In the Gold Cup that ended not long ago, Keller performed outstandingly and helped the US team capture the championship.
In the current America Cup, he was still entrusted with the important task by head coach Bradley, but what can one man do against overwhelming odds; a US team of "Elite Young Guards" setting out to do battle is fundamentally no rival for such South American giants as Argentina and Paraguay.  In these two matches, the goal he guarded was penetrated 7 times.
The next match, paired up against Columbia, is very likely to be the US team's and Keller's final performance in the current America Cup.
(Overseas Involving China) Blackberry Smart Phone to Land on Chinese Market in Late August
Xinhua News Agency, Ottawa, July 4 - According to a report in Canada's The Globe and Mail on the 4th, after eight years of efforts, Canadian RIM Company's Blackberry (Blackberry) smart phone finally obtained approval to enter the Chinese market.  The first Blackberry smart phones will hit the Chinese market in late August.
RIM Chief Executive Officer Jim Balsillie said that its Blackberry cell phone service will be introduced to business customers in China's major cities, including Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou.
The Globe and The Mail quoted a manager from the RIM Beijing office as saying that the Blackberry 8700g model smart phone will land on the Chinese market in late August; its selling price will be approximately US $ 700.  At present, 5000 orders have been received.
Balsillie said that the launch of Apple Corporation's iPhone onto the market last week has made people pay more and more attention to smart phones.  As iPhone's rival, the Blackberry cell phone is currently sold in more than 100 countries across the world.
According to statistics, in the first quarter of this year, the number of newly added RIM's Blackberry cell phone users reached 1200000, and the total number of users has reached 9200000.
(International) Spain: Masked Husband Arrested after Attempt to Murder Wife
Xinhua News Agency, Madrid, July 7 - A Spanish woman was attacked by a masked bandit.  During the struggle, she tore off the bandit's mask and was shocked to discover the assailant was her own husband.  Police have already arrested him.
According to local media reports on the 6th, the woman works at a bakery store in Valencia.
One day, a masked man burst into the store; she thought he was a robber and told him to go to the drawer and take the money and leave.
However, that man did not take the money but rather throttled the woman's neck intending to kill her.
She thought of playing dead to escape her misfortune, but that man nonetheless did not release her and still kicked her and throttled her neck.
During the struggle, the woman tore off the ruffian's mask and was shocked to discover that the person was actually her husband.
The assailant has been arrested by police.
The woman victim said to the media that she and her husband are in the process of filing for a divorce because they have emotional conflicts.  They have two children.
(International) Germany Calls on Russia to Pass the Latvia-Russia Border Treaty as Soon as Possible
Xinhua News Agency, Riga, July 12 (Correspondent Yang Dehong) The German Foreign Minister Steinmeier, visiting Latvia on the 12th, called on the Russians to pass the Latvia-Russia border treaty as soon as possible.
That day, Steinmeier and Latvian Foreign Minister Pabriks held a meeting together.  Both parties primarily discussed Latvian-German relations, Latvian and EU cooperation, and other issues.  They also exchanged opinions and perspectives on the development of Latvian-Russian relations and EU-Russian relations.
At the press conference held after the meeting, Steinmeier called on the Russians to pass the Latvia-Russia border treaty as soon as possible.
Steinmeier said that the pace of improvement in relations between Latvia, all the Baltic Sea States, and Russia is relatively slow.  Signing of the Latvia-Russia border treaty testifies to the course of development of Latvian-Russian relations, but the "shadow of history" also may possibly cause Latvian-Russian relations to regress again and he hopes the Russian side can pass the Latvia-Russia border treaty as early as possible in order to expedite forward development of relations between the two countries.
On March 27 this year, after as long as ten years of negotiations, Latvian Prime Minister Kalvitis and Russian Prime Minister Fradkov signed a bi-national border treaty in Moscow.
On May 17, the Latvian parliament passed the Latvia-Russia border treaty.
According to Latvian media reports, the Russian parliament will vote on the treaty in the near future.
(International) Hyundai Motor Denies Intent to Purchase Volvo
Xinhua News Agency, Seoul, July 18 - A spokesperson for Korea's Hyundai Motor Company said in Seoul on the 18th that the company has no intention of purchasing Volvo or any brand under the Ford Motor Company label.
A few days ago, the Sunday Times and New York Times both reported the news that Ford is likely to sell Volvo.
In the report, the Sunday Times further said that Korea's Hyundai Motor Company is a potential buyer of Volvo.
A Hyundai Motor Company spokesperson said, "We have absolutely no interest in purchasing Volvo, Jaguar or Land Rover" and "at this moment, Hyundai is busy carrying out its own expansion plans and simply has no time for other matters."
In 1999, Ford invested US $ 6450000000 to purchase the Volvo brand from Sweden's Volvo Group.
At present, Volvo, Land Rover, Jaguar, etc. all belong to Ford's Premier Automotive Group (PAG).
In March this year, debt-ridden Ford sold the PAG subsidiary Aston Martin for US $ 848000000; last month it also indicated it was thinking about selling Land Rover and Jaguar.
White Rabbit Milk Candy Resumes Export as Overseas Distributors Place  Additional Orders
Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 24 (Correspondents Xu Shousong and Yu Lihong) The correspondents learned from Guan Sheng Yuan (Group) Company Limited that the White Rabbit Milk Candy detained for a time at the Shanghai port resumed export in the last few days.  A number of overseas distributors also successively requested to place additional orders.
A few days ago, Mr. Lin Qingrong at Funan Company, Guan Sheng Yuan's distributor in Singapore, sent a telegram to Guan Sheng Yuan Group expressing that, due to the the result of a sample test by the Agri-Food &amp; Veterinary Authority of Singapore on White Rabbit Milk Candy that showed it did not contain formaldehyde, it can be sold as normal on the market.  He, therefore, requested to place additional orders.
Guan Sheng Yuan's Malaysian distributor, Fengsheng Company, expressed a request for Guan Sheng Yuan to immediately ship one container of White Rabbit Milk Candy to Malaysia from Shanghai.
Ng Fung Trading Company Limited, Guan Sheng Yuan's distributor in Hong Kong, also sent a telegram to Guan Sheng Yuan saying that the Hong Kong Center for Food Safety drew samples of White Rabbit Milk Candy in Hong Kong supermarkets and, after performing lab tests, confirmed no formaldehyde component.
Ng Fung Trading Company Limited has already received a notice from Hong Kong's Vanguard supermarket of the decision to resume sales of White Rabbit Milk Candy in over 100 of their stores in Hong Kong.
To our understanding, the ten containers of White Rabbit Milk Candy detained in the Shanghai port for a time have gradually resumed export.
At present, seven containers of White Rabbit Milk Candy are being sent on their way to Singapore, Costa Rica, Malaysia, India, Nepal, the US and other countries.
(International) Suspected Offender Arrested for Making British Supermarket Bomb Threat
Xinhua News Agency, London, July 26 - British police announced on the 26th that a suspected offender has been arrested in Clitheroe, Lancaster County, on the 23rd for making bomb threats to the British "Tesco" supermarket in the middle of July.
Police said the person is named Philip McHugh, who is 51 years old and unemployed.  He will be charged with carrying out blackmail and making bomb scares.
On the afternoon of July 14 (Saturday), 14 "Tesco" supermarkets throughout Britain were urgently closed by police due to receiving bomb threats and did not return to business until the next day.
Saturday just happens to be the peak time for the British people to go shopping at the supermarket.  At that time, the closing of 14 supermarkets caused Britain's largest supermarket chain to lose several million British pounds of sales income.
British police subsequently carried out a criminal investigation on this bomb threat incident and announced that in this incident they did not discover any sign of terrorist activity, but certain economic motivations are likely to be behind this.
(International) Turkish Ruling Party Wins Parliamentary Election
Xinhua News Agency, Ankara, July 30 (Correspondent Wang Jian) The final results of the 23rd parliamentary election on the 30th announced by Turkey's Supreme Electoral Commission show that the ruling Justice and Development Party obtained 341 seats of the 550 seat assembly, once again gaining the power to form a single-party cabinet.
During the parliamentary election held on July 22, the main opposition party, the Republican People's Party, obtained 112 assembly seats.
The National Movement Party obtained 71 assembly seats during the election.
In addition to the above three political parties, another 26 non-party affiliated people were elected as members of parliament.
Turkey's new parliamentary session will hold its first meeting on August 4.
In due course, the entire members of parliament will be sworn into office and start to execute their duties.
After this, the parliament will elect a new parliament speaker by way of a secret ballot.
The Turkish parliamentary election was originally planned to be held in November but during the presidential elections at the end of April, because the opposition party boycotted the only candidate, deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Gül of the Justice and Development Party, it resulted in the failure of the presidential elections, and the parliamentary election was consequentially brought forward.
Strong Quake Affects Parts Production; Japanese Automotive Plants Reduce or Stop Production
Japan was hit with a strong earthquake this week, causing a shortage in automotive parts.  Automakers such as Toyota and Nissan said today that they would scale back production, even suspending domestic car production.
Japan was hit with a strong 6.8 Richter magnitude earthquake two days ago.  Automotive parts manufacturer Riken was forced to suspend operation of its factory in northwest Tokyo, which then impacted production of automotive plants.
Toyota will suspend domestic car production from tonight until the 21st, said a spokeswoman from Toyota, the world's top-selling automaker.
Nissan spokesperson Nakagawa said that from the day after tomorrow to the 23rd, two out of three Nissan plants in Japan would suspend some production operations, and the situation will be reassessed during the weekend.
He said that of each plant's two production lines, one of the production lines will be affected.  However, the company might add shifts next month to make up for delayed production progress.
Suzuki Auto said that it would partially suspend production for three days starting tomorrow.  Japan's Fuji Heavy Industries, which produces Subaru vehicles, will also suspend production of small cars starting tomorrow and assess the situation on the 21st.
And Honda Motor said that next week it might suspend some production line operations that rely on parts supplies.
At least 10 people died and more than 1000 people were injured as a result of this earthquake.  Hundreds of houses collapsed, all the more forcing plants in the disaster area to stop operations.
Indonesia Cancels Sale of British Eco-friendly Branded Bag Due to Worries over Chaotic Buying Stampede
Agents said today that Indonesia has cancelled sale activities for the British eco-friendly branded bag, in view of the chaos triggered by a wave of buying stampede in Hong Kong earlier this month.
The manager of branded shop "On Pedder" located in the upscale Plaza Indonesia said, "We cancelled the market launch for the eco-friendly bag in view of what happened in Hong Kong.
It's not worth it if people are fighting over a 140000 rupiah (about NT $ 494) bag."
Thousands of Hong Kong people gathered outside sale stores on the 6th, ready to rush to buy the limited quantity eco-friendly bag designed by British designer Anya Hindmarch, printed "I'm Not A Plastic Bag."  However, the stores refused to open their doors, causing the situation to become chaotic.
This fine product calling for eco-friendliness is trying to replace plastic bags, but unexpectedly became an overnight fashion icon in London and New York, triggering a buying stampede, with prices on the eBay auction website already skyrocketing to several times the retail price.
"On Pedder," the only authorized seller in Indonesia, expressed uncertainty whether to start selling in a few days.
Trial Opens in "Black Brick Kiln" Case of Wang Bingbing of Shanxi Hongdong Caosheng Village (Picture)
Chinanews.com, July 4 - Amidst public attention, the first instance court of Shanxi Province Linfen Intermediate Court began a trial this morning in the "black brick kiln" case of Wang Bingbing of Caosheng Village, Guangshengsi Township, Hongdong County, Shanxi.
Many domestic media outlets are paying attention to the progress of this case.
Because of extra precautions by relevant local departments, some reporters could not enter the scene to carry out live interviews.
The court proceedings are currently still in progress.
A staff member at the criminal court of Linfen Intermediate Court disclosed that hearings are expected to conclude the same day if court proceedings go smoothly.
However, it is still unknown whether the court will pass judgment on this case.
At around 9 a.m., reporters noticed that outside the main entrance of Linfen Intermediate Court, passersby appeared calm, coming and going as usual.
They are probably used to the court proceeding activities currently being held in court.
"In the end there will be a conclusion.  I believe the law is just,"
said an elderly person to himself, passing by this spot while raising his head to glance at the national emblem.
Earlier, news from Hongdong County confirmed that the county people's congress representative rights of Wang Dongji, Wang Bingbing's father and former Caosheng Village party branch secretary, had been lawfully removed.
Earlier, Wang Dongji, suspected of involvement in disciplinary violations in the Wang Bingbing "black brick kiln" case, was stripped of his village party branch secretary duties and discharged from the party.
The Shanxi black brick kiln slave labor incident triggered by the Wang Bingbing black brick kiln case had attracted attention domestically and internationally.  CPC top leaders sent down written instructions requesting detailed investigations.
Ministry of Civil Affairs Penalizes China Council for the Promotion of Area Development: Activities Suspended for Three Months
Chinanews.com, July 11 - According to the information from the Ministry of Civil Affairs website, the Ministry of Civil Affairs imposed administrative sanctions on the China Council for the Promotion of Area Development on July 9, suspending its activities for three months.
The sanction order shows that the China Council for the Promotion of Area Development committed the following illegal acts: 1. collecting membership fees which exceeded standards; 2. using membership fee receipts to collect other fees from non-member organizations.
An investigation showed that the council's standard membership fee for organization members is 2000 yuan per year.  Between June 2005 and February 2007, the council issued membership fee receipts to a total of more than 20 organizations.  Aside from collecting the 2000 yuan membership fee from one organization member, 10000 to 100000 yuan was collected from each remaining organization.  The total amount came to more than 800000 yuan, including management and other fees collected from branch organizations and internal organizations, seriously violatiing the relevant rules and regulations.
Based on provisions in Item (8), Clause 1, Article 33 of the Regulation on Registration and Administration of Social Organizations, the Ministry of Civil Affairs imposed administrative sanctions on the council by suspending its activities for a fixed term of three months, and lawfully put away relevant items of the council, such as seals.
Germany Plans to Lower Barriers for Bringing in Specialized Skilled Workers
Staff report, Berlin, July 1 (Correspondent Wang Huaicheng)
German Education and Research Minister Schavan said a few days ago that Germany should lower the Immigration Law restrictions on bringing in foreign specialized skilled workers, using an introduction of foreign talent to solve Germany's specialized skilled worker shortage problems.
According to an OECD report, by 2010, Germany's labor force between 15 and 64 years old will be shrinking yearly.
Without enough immigrants, Germany's labor force by 2020 will be 6% smaller than now.
However, reports from organizations such as the Federation of German Employers' Associations and the Association for German Engineers show that there is a relatively large shortage in the current German labor market for engineers and specialized technology workers.
According to data from the German Federal Labor Agency, the German labor market had a supply shortage of about 12700 engineers and a supply shortage of about 9600 technicians in May of this year.
Germany has set high barriers for the introduction of foreign skilled workers in order to protect local employment.
Germany's Immigration Law states that specialized skilled workers from non-EU countries cannot earn less than € 85500 per year in Germany, or else cannot obtain German work and residency permits.
Schavan proposed bringing this limit down to between 40000 and € 60000.
The Ringing of the Alarm Bell at this Moment "Connects" Hong Kong with the Rest of the World in a Joint Celebration of 10 Years Since the Handover
On July 1, the alarm bell at Jinghai temple memorial hall in Nanjing was once again struck and rung with a melodious resound.
This echo of profound historical significance "connected" the Mainland and Hong Kong through television; citizens of Nanjing and their fellow countrymen in Hong Kong "shared this moment with the entire world" together celebrating the 10th anniversary of Hong Kong's handover to the motherland.
At midnight on July 1 ten years ago, the air above the bell tower at Jinghai temple memorial in Nanjing reverberated to the sounds of one hundred and fifty-five strikes of the alarm bell.  It was saying adieu to the humiliating history of the cession of Hong Kong Island.
Outside the entrance to the small memorial hall, people from all walks of society in Nanjing gathered together.  They said they will use their own two hands to strike this alarm bell, to warn themselves and later generations never to forget history.
The alarm bell is 1.842 meters high and it was in 1842 that the "Nanjing Treaty" was signed, right at the time the Opium War broke out.
The shoulder of the bell is 1.997 meters high and 1997 is the year of the Hong Kong handover.
The planner and founder of the alarm bell that year, Wang Fengling, explained, "Five rows of the character '10000' encircle the body of the bell.  The entire bronze bell uses high relief sculpture and two dragons support a ball of fire which symbolizes that Hong Kong is the motherland's 'Pearl of the Orient.'  Finally, the flower of Nanjing city, plum blossom, is the figure on the bell's strikeplate."
The first member of the Democracy Party that year to propose making the alarm bell, Yu Xiaodong, said emotionally, "Before I realized it, it is already ten years since Hong Kong's return."  He hopes that Hong Kong's tomorrow can be like the sound of the bell, "bright and long, and stretching forever without end."

Three Main Functions of Modern Military Uniforms
One, identification function.
To distinguish the important insignia of different nations' armies, different types of soldiers, armies and civilians.
Among the armies of over 100 large and small nations in the world, although the basic use of a military uniform is the same, the military uniforms of no two countries' armies are completely the same.
Two, symbolic function.
To a certain degree, a military uniform is the image of a nation's spirit, a reflection of its national characteristics, and is a focused embodiment of a nation's military capability and its soldiers' accomplishments.
In the three main categories of military uniform: ceremonial uniform, service uniform and training uniform, nothing is more capable of fully displaying national and military prestige than a stiff and tight-fitted, handsome-looking ceremonial uniform.
Three, protective function.
With the rapid development of new high-technology weapons, improving the overall protective performance of new types of training uniform and making military uniform bullet proof, detection proof, chemical proof, germ proof, radiation proof, as well as having temperature control, moisture control, gas control and various other functions, has become the foremost issue in military uniform development.

Certain Battalion Party Committee Dares to Stick to its Guns to Handle Thorny Problem
Staff Report, Chengdu, July 3
Report by Qu Yimao and Yang Ruiyu: "We are able to live in an apartment thanks to the resolve and determination of the Battalion Party Committee to clear out the rooms."
Today, more than ten cadres from a communication training battalion in Chengdu Military Command all look very happy as they move to an apartment block .  They are full of admiration and appreciation at the style in which "the team" of the Battalion Party Committee dared to stick to their guns and struggle against obstacles to resolve a thorny problem.
In the last few years, as personnel have been replaced, a portion of this battalion's apartments in this family dormitory building was over-occupied, contrary to regulations, which made it difficult for cadres in service to find accommodation.  Officers and men have expressed considerable objections concerning this matter.
The battalion also cleared out the apartments several times before, but due to resistance they settled the matter by leaving it unsettled, which turned this issue into a long-standing problem.
"If only one sticks to one's guns and is fair and reasonable, there are no unsolvable problems."
After the new party committee team achieved consensus, major leaders came out in person to set about completely clearing up all the problems where apartments were occupied contrary to regulations.
On the one hand, they appealed to people's emotion and explained through reason, hoping that the people concerned would consider the overall situation; on the other hand they explained clearly the related policies and regulations on military apartments, pooled housing and economic housing, and made clear the party committee's determination, resolve and standpoint on principles.
For some people with housing elsewhere yet unwilling to withdraw from over-occupied housing, the party committee promptly contacted their work unit and took corresponding steps to urge them to actively cooperate with the army's work.
After two months of painstaking work, all the residents of buildings on the campgrounds that were over-occupied against regulations moved out on schedule and the serving battalion cadres were allotted housing according to regulations.
This style in which the Battalion Party Committee dares to stick to its guns and struggle against obstacles also created a domino effect: a few cadres originally unwilling to actively cooperate with the organization's allocation, now also, one by one, expressed submission to the organization's decision.

(Sports) For Beijing Olympic Games, Flower Season Altered for Flowers to Bloom in "Wrong Season"
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 28 (Correspondent Cui Junqiang) When next year's Olympics are held, Beijing in August, with its high temperature and humidity, is expected to transform into a sea of fresh flowers.
By employing technology to change the flower season, and other measures, scientific researchers have found a good strategy to add color to the Olympic Games.
At the "Summer Olympics Optimal New Flower Variety Selection and Cultivation Applications Research" project acceptance meeting held on the 28th in Beijing, assessment experts arrived at the conclusion that the use of new technology to spur and control flower cultivation will enable different flower types or varieties with different natural flower seasons to bloom in the same time in the summer, thus the best visual effect will be achieved in August when the Beijing Olympic Games will be held .
In the Beijing summer, often only a dozen or so types of blooming flowers can be seen.  The majority of flowers have either already withered or are still a long time away from their buds opening.
Through their endeavors, scientific researchers chose 206 types and over 400 varieties of the most optimal flowers for the Summer Olympics.
At the "2007 Olympics Flower Exhibition" to be held in Haidian Park, Beijing, around the one year countdown to the Beijing Olympic Games opening, a batch of fresh and bright-colored flowers carefully cultivated by scientific researchers, that in the past have been unable to naturally bloom in August, will welcome visitors.
