<seg id="1"> Russian Security Bureau Charges Exiled Oligarch Berezovksy with "Secretly Initiating a Political Coup"</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> On July 2, Borovkov, lawyer of the Russian oligarch Berezovsky exiled in London, announced that the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation has made a new formal charge accusing his client Berezovksky of "secretly planning a national political coup and attempting to violently take over Russian political authority. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Borovkov pointed out that in April this year, in an interview with a reporter from the British The Guardian, Berezovsky announced that he was prepared to initiate a "palace revolution" in Russia and confirmed that he provided financial support to the right wing elite representatives opposing the policies of the party in power.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Following this, the Investigation Office of the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation launched a criminal investigation against Berezovsky according to article 278 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation,"seizing power through violence."  In the last few days they formally lodged a corresponding indictment with Moscow's Savyolovsky court.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Reports say that in February 2006 the Russian Federation Chief Prosecutors Office issued a criminal indictment against Berezovsky on the same premise that the exiled oligarch confirmed in an interview that he planned to take over political power in Russia by force.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Since Berezovsky has continuously been exiled abroad and could not be extradited, in January 2007 the Russians temporarily terminated investigation of this case.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> On July 2, Russia's Savyolovsky court commenced hearing another criminal case against the exiled oligarch.  The Russian Chief Prosecutors Office accused Berezovsky of embezzling 214000000 Rubles from Aeroflot and laundering 16000000 Rubles.  After hearing the evidence the court decided to adjourn until July 12 when they will launch a court investigation.  In the meantime, they will assign a state defense attorney to the accused.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Berezovsky believes this is all a "farce" and categorically forbids his defense attorney from taking part in the hearing.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> According to US media reports on the 15th, the number of reports in the USA of heart disease and other adverse reactions caused by the anti-diabetes drug Avandia has recently seen a dramatic rise.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The US Food and Drug Administration issued a safety warning in May this year suggesting that diabetes patients use Avandia cautiously, because scientists published a research report in the issue of New England Journal of Medicine published on May 21 that said this blockbuster drug will greatly increase the heart disease incidence rate and death rate of patients.</seg>
<seg id="4"> As a result, the safety of Avandia came under close scrutiny from doctors and patients.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Statistics show within around one month of issuing the safety warning, the US FDA received 357 reports of adverse reactions caused by Avandia, of those 38 were fatality reports.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Whereas in January and February this year, the FDA received only 50 and 73 reports of adverse reactions respectively.</seg>
<seg id="7"> These adverse reactions were as minor as blistering and as major as sudden cardiac death.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> However, experts at the US FDA believe that now it is still early to arrive at the conclusion that Avandia is unsafe.</seg>
<seg id="9"> On July 30, the FDA will hold a hearing concerning the safety of Avandia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Introduced to the market in 1999, Avandia is a kind of insulin sensitizer suitable for the treatment of Type II diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="11"> In the entire world there are about 6000000 diabetes patients who have taken or are taking Avandia.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Avandia's manufacturer, the British GlaxoSmithKline Company, has always considered that Avandia is safe and that for patients "the benefits are greater than the risks."</seg>

<seg id="1"> US Department of Defense Reconsiders Plan to Cut American Troops Posted in Europe</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> A US Department of Defense official said on the 23rd that due to the Iraq war and the change in the world situation, the U.S. Department of Defense is currently reconsidering its plan, formulated in 2002, to cut the number of US troops posted in Europe by roughly half.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> US media quoted a Department of Defense official saying, because the Iraq war is still in progress and US relations with Russia and Iran have worsened, those at the leadership level of the Department of Defense questioned the viability of the plan to cut troops posted in Europe.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> In 2002, the Secretary of Defense at the time, Rumsfeld, announced that before 2012 the US will cut the number of troops posted in Europe from the original 113000 people to 71000 people, in order to build a "smaller but superior" new model army.</seg>
<seg id="5"> At present, the total military strength of the US Army posted in Europe has already been reduced to 100000 people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> However, in June this year, Chief of Staff Craddock at US European Command Headquarter submitted a report to the current Secretary of Defense Gates, raising doubts about the abovementioned reduction plan.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The report said that while the military strength of US troops posted in Europe was being reduced, many of the units were rotated and transferred to fight in Iraq and Afghanistan.  This caused a shortfall in US troops posted in Europe and even made it impossible to carry out cooperation with their European allies as normal.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The report suggested terminating the plan to reduce US troops posted in Europe.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Associated experts in the United States believe that the above phenomenon indicates that the prolonged delay in resolving the Iraq war has already upset the original adjustment plan of the US troops.</seg>

<seg id="3"> This system will also be progressively launched across the entire country.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The food and beverage industry hygiene supervision public notification system is based on routine hygiene supervision and carries out on-site supervision and inspection of nine important hygiene situations: the food and beverage company's health permit; health management system; health management personnel; workers' health certificates; food quality, labels and markings; hygiene protection in the food processing process; processing workshop environmental hygiene; food and beverage utensils cleaning and disinfection; and main ingredient procurement quality certificates, etc.  Based on the inspection results, an evaluation verdict of "good hygiene status," "average hygiene status" or "poor hygiene status" is issued, respectively denoted using three types of face symbols: "smiling face," "no expression" and "sad face."</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Staff Report by Cao Jiawei and Zhu Chunbin: On June 18, in a class where Jiangsu province Jingjiang City People's Armed Forces full-time cadres assembled for training, a tutorial course on "Winning the Psychological War under Informationalized Conditions" taught by Lu Yuqing, director of the People's Armed Forces Department from Xilai town, received unanimous acclaim from participating students.</seg>
<seg id="3"> This is a new change achieved by the People's Armed Force Department of this city through giving their full-time cadre actual pressure appropriate to their positions in an effort to improve their overall quality .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> At the beginning of this year, during a grassroots survey, this People's Armed Forces Department Party Committee discovered that some full-time cadres have worked for a long number of years, held too many posts concurrently and were not putting their main effort into doing People's Armed Forces work.</seg>
<seg id="5"> For this reason, they adopted centralized training, held meetings instead of lectures, relied on local party schools to perform training and other methods, and periodically carried out training for full-time cadre in an effort to solve such problems as the full-time cadres' narrow sphere of knowledge, singular professional capability, etc.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Based on core work, they boldly assigned duties and increased the pressure on People's Armed Forces full-time cadres, and through on-the-job training improved their work competence.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Meanwhile, they actively coordinated with local organization departments and jointly drew up the "People's Armed Forces Full-time Cadre Achieving Position through Competition Plan."  This clarifies the regulation that the director of the People's Armed Forces Department must enter the party committee leading group at the same grade and may not concurrently hold any other offices.</seg>
<seg id="8"> A full-time cadre rotation arrangement system was established to promptly rotate and exchange older full-time cadre unable to adapt to grassroots People's Armed Forces work, while those comrades with good overall character and strong work capabilities were given promotions and put to use.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Not long ago, Chen Yisong, the secretary in charge of the People's Armed Forces Department at New Century Shipyard Ltd., led a militia technical squad that innovated and developed an underwater vessel welding technology which made up for a deficiency in this nation.  He was given an accelerated promotion to director of the company's People's Armed Forces Department.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Staff Report by Xue Bingjian and Correspondent Xu Yeqing: The phenomenon of difficult organization, few resources, and individual operation in educating the "small, scattered, remote and direct" units will become a thing of the past at a Second Artillery base.</seg>
<seg id="3"> In recent days, this reporter learned that after half a year of trials, this base issued "Methods of Implementing the 'Ideological and Political Education Syllabus'" to the grassroots levels.  A number of ideological and political education coordination sections covering all the "small, scattered, remote and direct" units at the base were officially set in operation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> To promote effective implementation of the "Ideological and Political Education Syllabus," at the beginning of the year, this base used their organizational abilities to conduct an in-depth investigation into the current situation of ideological and political education in "small, scattered, remote and direct" units at the base.  They combed through the key problems affecting and restricting education time, staff and effectiveness, and preliminarily formed this kind of new education format of coordination sections for "small, scattered, remote and direct" units.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The specific modus operandi of the coordination section is to break down unit organization boundaries, specify a brigade or regiment level unit to take the lead in a region with relatively concentrated "small, scattered, remote and direct" units in unified planning of topical education.  Units having different subordinate relationships either attend classes nearby together or hold remote discussions by way of a video system.</seg>
<seg id="6"> A combined method of giving classes in rotation and competing for posts is adopted to unify allocation of educational strength.  Educational hardware in parts of a region was used jointly; and the information, data and educational experiences of all units were shared and exchanged.  Typical reporting tours in parts of the region are periodically organized, and officers and soldiers exchange what they have learned.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Each coordination section has established a full-time education liaison and a part-time educational information collector.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> On this basis, each coordination section has also set up systems to seek help on difficult problems, discuss important educational subject matters, report urgent ideological situations, and to test and appraise.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Director of the political department at the base, Zhang Shengmin, told reporters that establishing political education coordination sections has not only reduced wastage of educational resources, but has also deepened the effect of the education.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Some politics instructors were afraid to lose points in front of officers and men from other units, so they took the initiative to learn new knowledge and seek out new methods of education.</seg>
<seg id="11"> The officers and men receiving education also actively digested the educational content lest they sounded unprofessional in front of officers and men from neighboring units in their discussions and analyses.</seg>
<seg id="12"> In so doing, the enthusiasm of the educators and the educated has been both effectively stirred up.</seg>

<seg id="4"> As introduced by political commissar Su Chengsen, this is a concrete action taken by this department to push forward the open office work system.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> At the beginning of this year, this army party committee formulated the "Office and Grassroots Bidirectional Supervision," "Public Notices of Sensitive Issue," and other measures to strengthen the building of party conduct and clean government.  These require that important issues involving the immediate interests of officers and soldiers and army construction are only decided after listening to the opinion of grassroots officers and soldiers.  Also, depending upon the situation, the entire process of office standards, procedures, results, etc. are made public.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The army set up a suggestion box and notice board, opened up a "message board" on their Intranet and extensively collected everybody's opinions and suggestions.</seg>
<seg id="7"> At the beginning of the year, the soldier's dormitory refurbishment project started.  Before work got underway, the party committee extensively solicited opinion from officers and soldiers, and then issued a public tender notice and carried out public tender bidding.</seg>
<seg id="8"> This both saved expenditures and won the support of officers and soldiers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Conducting work openly and fairly has spurred a good atmosphere to take shape at the grassroots level.</seg>
<seg id="10"> In this army, whether it is settling upon work as large as 'hot issue' sensitive affairs or as small as taking personal vacation time to visit one's relatives, the everyday expenditure on mess accounts and other items, the grassroots company persists with scheduled public notices and publications, and take the initiative to accept mass supervision.</seg>

<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, July 11 (Correspondents Liu Yang and Pi Shuchu)</seg>
<seg id="3"> Thirteen pilots submitted their resignation, and "the boss," China Eastern Airlines Wuhan Limited Liability Company, wrote out a compensation sheet for as high as the massive amount of 105000000.  Up until now, this is a labor dispute case which involves Hubei province's largest compensation amount.</seg>
<seg id="4"> The Hubei Province Labor Dispute Arbitration Committee is currently examining this case.</seg>
<seg id="5"> In May this year, 13 pilots at China Eastern Wuhan Company successively submitted their resignation and were refused by the company.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Subsequently, in the beginning of June, the pilots one by one submitted labor arbitration applications to the Hubei Province Labor Dispute Arbitration Committee, petitioning for an arbitration decision to terminate their working relationship with China Eastern Wuhan Company.</seg>
<seg id="7"> After China Eastern Wuhan Company received the notice to respond to the lawsuit, they submitted a countersuit demanding the 13 pilots to separately pay them varying consequential damages of over 6000000 to over 10000000 yuan, in a total of 105000000 yuan, for dissolving the employment contract in breach of employment contract stipulations.</seg>
<seg id="8"> To our understanding, the pilots signed an open-ended employment contract with China Eastern and, unless termination conditions or dissolution conditions stipulated in the employment contract appear, the legal force of the employment contract will continue until the pilot's legal retirement age.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Russian Security Service Charges Exiled Oligarch with "Coup Plot"</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Borovkov, lawyer of the Russian oligarch Berezovsky exiled in London, said on July 2 that the Russian FSB has formally filed a new charge against his client, accusing Berezovsky of "conspiring to plot a coup against the state and attempting to seize Russian political power by violence."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> In an interview with a reporter of Britain's The Guardian in April this year, Berezovsky declared he was preparing to mount a "palace coup" in Russia, confirming he was providing financial assistance to representatives of the right-wing elites who were against the government policy, Borovkov noted.</seg>
<seg id="4"> The Russian FSB's Investigation Bureau immediately began criminal investigation in Berezovsky in compliance with article 278, Violent Seizure of Power, of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation and formally filed applicable charges to the Savelovsky Court in Moscow in recent days.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> It is learned that in February 2006, the Office of the Russian Persecutor General had filed criminal charges against Berezovsky, on the same ground that the exiled oligarch confirmed his attempt to obtain Russian political power by force.</seg>
<seg id="6"> As Berezovsky had been in exile abroad and could not be extradited, Russia halted probing of the case temporarily in January 2007.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The Savelovsky Court initiated another criminal case against the exiled oligarch, in which the Office of the Russian Persecutor General accused Berezovsky of embezzling funds of 214000000 rubles from a Russian airway and laundering 16000000 rubles. After hearings, the court has decided to postpone court probing until July 12 and will appoint a state defense attorney for the defendant during this time.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Berezovsky thought all these were "a farce" and clearly forbade his defense attorneys to participate in court trials.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> According to a US media report on the 15th, there has recently been a tendency of significant increase in the number of adverse reaction reports, such as cardiac diseases, caused by the anti-diabetes drug Avandia in the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The US Food and Drug Administration issued a safety warning in May this year, advising diabetes patients to take Avandia with caution, because scientists issued a study report in an edition of the New England Journal of Medicine published on May 21, saying the best-selling drug would significantly increase the rates of heart attack and death in patients.</seg>
<seg id="4"> The safety of Avandia has thus been closely watched by doctors and patients.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> According to statistics, within roughly a month after the safety warning, the US FDA received 357 reports of adverse reactions caused by Avandia, 38 of which are death reports.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Yet the FDA only received 50 and 73 reports of adverse reactions respectively in January and February this year.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The adverse reactions were as minor as blisters and as serious as sudden death due to heart attack.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> However, drug experts at the US FDA believe it is yet too early to conclude that Avandia is unsafe.</seg>
<seg id="9"> The FDA is going to hold a hearing regarding the safety of Avandia on July 30.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Avandia, introduced in 1999, is an insulin sensitizer for treating type II diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="11"> Some 6000000 diabetes patients around the world has taken or is taking Avandia.</seg>
<seg id="12"> The manufacturer of Avandia, the UK company GlaxoSmithKline, has believed Avandia is safe and is "more beneficial than harmful" to patients.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> A US Defense Department official said on the 23rd that the US Pentagon is reconsidering a 2002 plan to cut US troops stationed in Europe by about half because of the war in Iraq and changes in the world situation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> With the ongoing Iraq War and worsened US relations with Russia and Iran, the Pentagon leadership has questioned the feasibility of the plan to slash troops stationed in Europe, the US media said, quoting a Defense Department official.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> In 2002, the then Defense Secretary Rumsfeld announced the US would reduce troops in Europe from 113000 to 71000 by 2012, in order to create a "lean and effective" new force.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Total US troops stationed in Europe have decreased to 100000 so far.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> However, Craddock, Commander of the US European Command, submitted a report to current Defense Secretary Gates in June this year, in which he questioned the aforesaid reduction plan.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The report says the slash of US troops stationed in Europe is accompanied by rotational transfer of many forces to Iraq and Afghanistan for battles, which leads to a shortage of US military personnel stationed in Europe, such that they are unable to conduct regular cooperation with European allies.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The report recommends halting the plan to cut US troops in Europe.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Experts in the US believe the phenomenon above indicates that the Iraq War has been such a long drag that it has disrupted the original adjustment plan of the US military.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> By Cao Jiawei and Zhu Chunbin, PLA Daily: On June 18, at an intensive training program for armed force cadres in the city of Jingjiang, Jiangsu Province, the lecture Win the Psychological Warfare in the Context of Informationization by Lu Yuqing, Director of the Xilai Town Department of People's Armed Force, received positive comments amongst all participants.</seg>
<seg id="3"> This was a fresh change as a result of the city's Department of People's Armed Force loading burdens onto armed force cadres and working to boost the overall quality of armed force cadres in line with the reality of different posts.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> At the beginning of this year, when doing grassroot research, the Party committee of the Department of People's Armed Force found that some armed force cadres did not focus on doing work related to the armed forces due to long years of service and multiple duties.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Therefore, they have conducted training regularly for armed force cadres using such methods such as intensive training, meeting as a way of training, relying on local Party school to provide training, with a view to address problems such as narrow knowledge spectrum and lack of versatile work skills.</seg>
<seg id="6"> In line with the core responsibilities, it has assigned tasks and loaded burdens onto armed force cadres boldly to improve their competency through on-the-job practice.</seg>
<seg id="7"> In addition, by actively coordinating with local organization departments, they jointly formulated the Scheme of Position Competitions Amongst Armed Force Cadres, which explicitly requires head of an armed force department to be on the Party committee of the same level without concurrently assuming other jobs;</seg>
<seg id="8"> and set up an adjustment and exchange mechanism for armed force cadres, whereby some armed force cadres who are older or not suitable for grassroot armed force positions are adjusted or exchanged in a timely fashion, while comrades with good overall quality and high competency are promoted.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Recently, Chen Yisong, a clerk of the armed force department at the New Century Shipbuilding Co., Ltd., who led a militia technical unit to fill a void of the nation with their innovatively developed underwater ship welding technique, was promoted to the company's head of armed force department as an exception to the rule.</seg>

<seg id="1"> "SDRD" education collaboration areas Launched in SAF Base</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> By Xue Bingjian and Reporter Xu Yeqing, PLA Daily: The phenomenon where education at small, dispersed, remote and direct (SDRD) units is hard to organize, lacking in resources and individually carried out will be history in a base of the Second Artillery Force.</seg>
<seg id="3"> The reporters learned recently that after a six-month pilot project, the base handed down Steps to Implement "Ideological and Political Education Outline" and several ideological and political education collaboration areas that cover all its SDRD units have officially begun operation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> To promote effective implementation of the Ideological and Political Education Outline, the base organized efforts to perform in-depth investigation and research into the status of ideological and political education at SDRD units early this year and sorted out key problems that affected and constrained the time, people and effects of the education, creating the new education pattern of collaboration areas for SDRD units.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The specific practice of the collaboration areas is to break the bound of units and in an area where the SDRD units are relatively concentrated, designate a brigade or regiment level unit as the coordinator, which will conduct centralized planning of theme education. Units of different relationships of subordination and affiliation attend lectures together at a close location or hold remote discussions with video systems.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Education capabilities are centrally allocated by way of rotational lectures in conjunction with position competitions; education hardware within a area is used in a coordinated manner, information and data, as well as experience in education of each unit are shared and exchanged, report tours about typical examples in an area are organized regularly, and officers and soldiers discuss what they have learned from study.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Each collaboration area has put in place a full-time education contact and a part-time education information collector.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Building on this, the collaboration areas also established systems of seeking help with hard problems, joint consultations on major educational topics, emergency briefing of ideological situations, and that of assessment and evaluation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Zhang Shengmin, director of the base's Political Department, told the reporters that establishing the political education collaboration areas has not only minimized waste of educational resources, but also deepened the effects of education.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Some political instructors voluntarily learn new knowledge and seek new methods of education for fear of losing marks in front of officers and soldiers from other units.</seg>
<seg id="11"> Officers and soldiers receiving education also digest what is taught, for fear of saying anything unprofessional in front of officers and soldiers from friendly and neighboring units during discussion and analysis.</seg>
<seg id="12"> As such, passions of the educators and the educated are both effectively inspired.</seg>

<seg id="3"> By Wang Weiqin and special correspondent Li Deying: The authors saw on July 25 at the Service Company of a force at the Jinan Military Region that a bulletin board with such important issues as the force's invitations to tender for projects, financial spending, cadre promotions, and non commissioned officers joining the Party, was hung conspicuously in the display window.</seg>
<seg id="4"> According to the Commissar Su Chengsen, this was a concrete step of the force to promote the policy of transparent business procedures.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Early this year, with a view to enhance the construction of an ethical Party culture and an integral governing body, the Party committee of the force developed measures such as Reciprocal Supervision between Authorities and Grassroots and Public Notification of Sensitive Issues and requested that opinions of grassroot officers and soldiers be heard before decisions are made on every major issue related to the vital interests of officers and soldiers and the construction of the military force and that business handling criteria, procedures and results be made transparent as necessary throughout the process.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The military force set up an opinion box, a bulletin board, and a "message board" on the Local Area Network to collect people's comments and suggestions extensively.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Early the year, renovation work of the soldiers' dormitory building got started. Before work began, the Party committee office solicited opinions of officers and soldiers extensively and then issued tender information to invite tenders openly,</seg>
<seg id="8"> not only saving funds, but also winning the support of officers and soldiers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Transparent and fair business procedures have brought about a healthy culture at grassroots.</seg>
<seg id="10"> In this military force, grassroot companies have consistently issued notifications and announcements on a regular basis and voluntarily accepted people's monitoring on such major issues as the decision of a hot and sensitive matter to such petty issues as family visits and vacations of individuals or daily expenses of food accounts.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Borovkov, attorney of Russian magnate Berezovsky who is in exile in London, announced on July 2 that the Russian Federal Security Service has formally indicted his client with a new charge by accusing Berezovsky of "conspiring to stage a coup with an attempt to seize political power in Russia by force".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Borovkov said that during an interview with a reporter of the Guardian  in Britain this April, Berezovsky announced that he was preparing to mount a "palace coup" in Russia and confirmed that he was providing financial support to representatives of the Rightist elites who opposed to the policies of the authorities.</seg>
<seg id="4"> The Investigation Directorate of the Russian Federal Security Service immediately initiated a criminal case against Berezovsky under Article 278  "forcible seizure of power" of the Penal Code of the Russian Federation and formally filed a corresponding charge with Moscow's Savelovsky Court recently.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Allegedly, the Russian Office of the Prosecutor-General had filed a criminal charge against Berezovsky in February 2006 with the same evidence that the exiled tycoon confirmed in an interview his attempt to seize political power in Russia by force.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Since Berezovsky had been in exile ever since and could not be extradited, Russia temporarily terminated the investigation of the case in January 2007.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> On July 2, Moscow's Savelovsky Court began the hearing of another criminal case against the exiled magnate. The Russian Office of the Prosecutor-General charged Berezovsky with embezzling Russian airline Aeroflot of £ 214000000 in capital and laundering £ 16000000. After hearing the evidence, the court decided to postpone the court investigation to July 12. It will assign a state-appointed defense attorney for the defendant here.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Berezovsky argued that these are all "farces" and clearly prohibited his defense attorney to take part in the court hearings.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> According to reports of U.S. media on the 15th, the number of reports on adverse reactions caused by diabetes drug Avandia such as heart attack has significantly increased in the United States in recent days.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a safety warning this May suggesting diabetics to take precaution in taking Avandia because scientists published a study report in the May 21 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine stating that this best-selling drug will greatly increase patients' risk of heart attack and death rate.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Doctors and patients thus paid close attention to the safety of Avandia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Statistics showed that within approximately a month after the safety warning was issued, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration received 357 reports on adverse reactions caused by Avandia, 38 of which were reports of death.</seg>
<seg id="6"> While in January and February this year, the Food and Drug Administration only received 50 and 73 cases of adverse reaction reports respectively.</seg>
<seg id="7"> These adverse reactions range from minor one of having blisters to serious one of sudden death from heart attack.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> However, drug experts at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration believed that it is now still too early to draw a conclusion that Avandia is unsafe.</seg>
<seg id="9"> The Food and Drug Administration will hold a hearing on the safety of Avandia on July 30.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Avandia, an insulin sensitizer, was introduced in 1999. It is suitable for treating type II diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="11"> There are approximately 6000000 diabetics worldwide who have taken or are currently taking Avandia.</seg>
<seg id="12"> GlaxoSmithKline, the British manufacturer of Avandia, has always considered Avandia safe and 'has more benefits than harm' for the patients.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> An official of the U.S. Department of Defense said on the 23rd that due to the War on Iraq and changes in global situation, the U.S. Department of Defense is reconsidering its plan to cut approximately half of the U.S. troops in Europe formulated in 2002.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> U.S. media quoted a Department of Defense official as saying that since the War on Iraq is still going on and the US-Russia and US-Iran relationships are deteriorating, the leadership at the Department of Defense raised doubts about the feasibility of the plan to cut the troops in Europe.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> In 2002, the then Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld announced that the United States would reduce the original 113000 troops in Europe to 71000 by 2012 in order to build a new "small and elite" army.</seg>
<seg id="5"> The number of U.S. troops in Europe is currently reduced to 100000.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> However, Craddock, commander-in-chief of U.S. European Command, submitted a report to the current Secretary of Defense Gates in June questioning the above reduction plan.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The report said that while the U.S. troops in Europe are being reduced, many troops are be rotated into Iraq and Afghanistan to fight, thus causing a shortage in U.S. troops in Europe. As a result, they cannot cooperate normally with their European allies.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The report suggested a halt to the plan to cut U.S. troops in Europe.</seg>

<seg id="7"> At the same time, they actively coordinated with local organizations and departments and jointly formulated the Program for Cadres of the Department of People's Armed Forces to Compete for Job Positions that clearly stipulated that chiefs of the Department of Armed Forces must join the team of Party committee at the same level and not to hold other concurrent duties;</seg>
<seg id="8"> they established the adjustment and exchange mechanism for cadres of the Department of People's Armed Forces. For cadres of the Department of People's Armed Forces who are relatively old and cannot adapt to grassroots armed forces work, they made adjustments and exchanges immediately. For compatriots who had good comprehensive qualities and strong work abilities, they promoted and employed them.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> This newspaper, reported by Xue Bingjian, Reporter Xu Yeqing: The phenomena of difficult organization, limited resources, and lack of coordination in education encountered by small, scattered, remote, and independent units will become history for a base of the Second Artillery.</seg>
<seg id="3"> The reporters recently learned that after half a year of pilot, the base promulgated the Enactment Measures to Implement Ideological and Political Education Syllabus that cover several ideological and political education cooperation zones in all small, scattered, remote, and independent units at the base. The measures are officially in operation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> In order to promote the effective implementation of the Ideological and Political Education Syllabus, the base allocated resources to conduct an in-depth survey on the ideological and political education situation in small, scattered, remote, and independent units in the beginning of the year. They sorted out key issues that affected and restricted the time, personnel, and effects of the education and initially formed the new educational model of cooperation zones for small, scattered, remote, and independent units.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The details of the cooperation zones are, break away from the restrictions of authorized force of the units, and designate a unit at the brigade or regiment level in a sub-area where small, scattered, remote, and independent units are relatively concentrated to take the lead to conduct standardized planning of thematic education. Units under different affiliations will attend classes together nearby or to hold long-distance discussions by means of video system.</seg>
<seg id="6"> They adopt the practice of integrating teaching rotation and competing for job positions to conduct consolidated allocation of education force. Education hardware in the sub-area is put under centralized use. Information and data of all units, as well as education experiences are shared and exchanged. Report tours by model sub-areas and sharing of educational experiences among officers and men are regularly organized.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Each cooperation unit has set up full-time education contacts and part-time education information gatherers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> On this foundation, all cooperation zones have also established systems for seeking help in difficult questions, discussions on major educational topics, notification of emergency ideological situations, and examination and assessment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Zhang Shengmin, chief of the Political Department at the base, told reporters that the establishment of political education cooperation zones both reduces waste in educational resources and deepens educational effects.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Some political instructors worry that they will lose points in front of officers and men from outside units, so they take the initiative to learn new knowledge and explore new educational methods.</seg>
<seg id="11"> Officers and men being taught also actively digest educational contents in fear that they will sound unprofessional in front of officers and men from neighboring units during discussion, differentiation, and analysis.</seg>
<seg id="12"> In this case, the enthusiasm of both the educators and the ones who receive the education is effectively stimulated.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> This newspaper</seg>
<seg id="3"> Reported by Wang Weiqin, Special Correspondent Li Deying: On July 25, the reporters saw at the combat support company of a unit under the Jinan Military Command that a notification board with important matters including calls for bids on projects of the unit, financial expenses, promotions of cadres, and admittance of warrant officers to the Party written on it was hung at an eye-catching spot in the display window.</seg>
<seg id="4"> According to Political Commissar Su Chengsen, this is a concrete measure that the unit adopts to advance the system of open work style.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Early this year, in order to strengthen the building of Party's style and of a clean government, the Party committee of this unit formulated measures including the Two-Way Supervision between State Organs and Grassroots and the Notification of the Public on Sensitive Matters. They requested decisions on major issues that involve personal interests of officers and soldiers and the building of the unit to be made after seeking opinions from grassroots soldiers as well as disclosure of the entire course of work including standards applied, procedures, and results based on the situation.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The unit has set up a suggestion box and notification board, as well as established a "message board" on the LAN to gather opinions and suggestions of the people on a large scale.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The soldiers' dormitory renovation project began at the beginning of the year. Before the project started, the Party committee solicited opinions from officers and soldiers extensively and then released bidding information and implemented open bidding.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The measure had saved fund and won the support of the officers and soldiers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Openness and fairness in work has promoted the formation of good morals at grassroots.</seg>
<seg id="10"> In this unit, whether they are major matters such as determination of central and sensitive issues or minor matters such as going home to visit relatives or taking vacation of an individual and daily expenses on food accounts, the grassroots companies still insist on notifying and announcing the matters regularly and subjecting to public monitoring conscientiously.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, July 11 (Reporters Liu Yang, Pi Shuchu)</seg>
<seg id="3"> China Eastern Airlines Wuhan Corp. Ltd., the "employer" of 13 pilots who resigned, claimed a huge compensation of 105000000 yuan against them. This labor dispute case involves the biggest claim ever in Hubei Province.</seg>
<seg id="4"> The Hubei Labor Dispute Arbitration Committee is currently hearing the case.</seg>
<seg id="5"> In May, 13 pilots working for the China Eastern Airlines Wuhan Corp. Ltd. resigned one after another. Their resignations were declined by the company.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Soon afterwards, in early June, the pilots submitted applications for labor arbitration with the Hubei Labor Arbitration Committee successively requesting a ruling to terminate the labor relations with the China Eastern Airlines Wuhan Corp. Ltd.</seg>
<seg id="7"> After the China Eastern Airlines Wuhan Corp. Ltd. received the Notice of Charge, it filed a counterclaim demanding the 13 pilots to pay the company for damages ranging from over 6000000 yuan to 10000000 yuan respectively incurred by the violation of agreements in the labor contracts and the termination of the labor contracts with a total of 105000000 yuan.</seg>
<seg id="8"> It was learned that the contracts the pilots signed with the China Eastern Airlines were ones without fixed time limit. Unless termination conditions or renunciation conditions agreed upon in the labor contracts appear, the labor contracts will be effective until the pilots reach legal retirement age.</seg>
<seg id="9"> The Hubei Labor Arbitration Committee will hear and handle the case together as an appeal and a counterclaim. The hearing is expected to end by August 8.</seg>

<seg id="4"> According to the rules of the International Boxing Federation, the length of boxing ring ropes should be 6.1 meters long in international matches.

<seg id="5"> Roque said, "We filed a formal protest because this does not just affect the country of Cuba but involves all the people.</seg>
<seg id="6"> If the ropes are too short, it will affect the sidestep movements of boxers."</seg>
<seg id="7"> He also said jokingly, "If they cannot find ropes that meet Olympics standards in Rio, they can find them somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="8"> We would have brought them from Cuba if we had known."</seg>

<seg id="2"> A special hearing called by the FIA World Motor Sport Council for the Ferrari technology spy case came to a close in Paris yesterday evening, Beijing time.  The McLaren team that had been summoned escaped suffering: the council decided not to penalize McLaren for the time being.</seg>
<seg id="3"> After the hearing, the official FIA website issued a statement saying, "The Vodafone McLaren Mercedes team was in possession of confidential Ferrari information, but there is currently insufficient evidence to prove that this information was improperly used for the FIA Formula One World Championship.  We'll therefore impose no penalty."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> However, the Ferrari technology spy case does not end with this.</seg>
<seg id="5"> In this decision, the World Motor Sport Council also said, "If it is found in the future that relevant Ferrari information has been used to the detriment of the championship, we reserve the right to call McLaren back to a World Motor Sport Council hearing, where they could face punishment of disqualification from not only the 2007 season, but also the 2008 season."</seg>

<seg id="6"> Experts believe that as there is currently no market for Renminbi derivatives, insurance institutions have insufficient means of avoiding risk.  As a result, it is not time yet for large-scale foreign exchange purchases.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Liu Lefei said that in terms of capital allocation, outbound investment should make up a certain ratio of overall allocations for insurance companies in the long run.</seg>
<seg id="8"> However, in view of relatively strong pressure for Renminbi appreciation at present, China Life will mainly use its own foreign exchange funds for outbound investments.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Foreign exchange purchases for outbound investment should be handled carefully under the current situation.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Chinanews.com, July 31 - On the 30th, Chen Shuibian questioned an attempt by the island's judicial personnel to interfere with the election of the Taiwan region's leaders.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Taiwan's "Department of Judicial Administration Director-General" Kao Chin-chih said on the same day that the current performance of the island's judges does not match what Chen Shuibian said, and requested that Chen Shuibian explain what he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> According to a report from Taiwan's United Daily News, on the 30th Chen Shuibian questioned interference, influence, and even attempts to control the election activities of the various parties' candidates, due to political factors or election considerations, by judges, public prosecutors, or investigators.  He claimed he hopes that this phenomenon does not exist in Taiwan, but that it might be very difficult.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> In response to Chen Shuibian's questioning, Taiwanese "Judicial Yuan President" Weng Yueh-sheng kept a low profile and did not respond.  "Secretary-General" Fan Kuang-chun, on the other hand, assigned Kao Chin-chih to speak on behalf of the "Judicial Yuan."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Kao Chin-chih said that both the Taiwanese constitution and the "Judges' Rules" proclaim in writing that judges must be nonpartisan, cannot participate in political party activities, and cannot assist in elections; judges abide by the relevant restrictions very carefully.  The "Judicial Yuan" believes the judges are all doing a good job.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Kao Chin-chih gave an example, noting that Judge Jang Shenq-shii of Kaohsiung "Branch High Court" participated a few years ago in a course conducted by the Ketagalan School, and was punished because the course was tainted by a political party.  The punishment resolution was by a self-disciplinary committee composed of judges.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Jang Shenq-shii once wanted to take part in DPP primary elections, and eventually decided to give up because there was controversy over his election participation while working.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Kao Chin-chih thinks that if the ruling of an individual case can be appealed to a higher court for relief, it cannot be inferred that a judge has political motives based only on whether the ruling is a win or a loss.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Don't Believe Blindly in the "Theoretical Field" of Law</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Clause 8 of the revised draft of the Law on Lawyers, which was recently submitted to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress for review, states: Those who have undertaken specialized work such as legal research or teaching and had a high-level title or the equivalent, upon application to become a lawyer can be allowed to practice law after examination and verification by the State Council's judicial administrative department.</seg>
<seg id="3"> (June 28, China Youth Daily)</seg>
<seg id="4"> In law, there is the "theoretical field" and the "practical field."  The former mainly includes "abstract actions" such as legal teaching and research work, while the latter undertakes more "concrete actions" such as litigation, legal consultation, and legal services.</seg>
<seg id="5"> For a long time, "intellectual disparagement" has existed between the "theoretical field" and "practical field" of law.  The "theoretical field" thinks that the "practical field" lacks necessary accomplishment in the law and are only mechanical "legalists"; meanwhile, the response of the "practical field" to criticism by the "theoretical field" is "theory cannot guide practice."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Concerning this kind of division of labor gap, what the law can do is stay neutral instead of giving strong support to either side.</seg>
<seg id="7"> However, the "specially licensed lawyer system" in the Law on Lawyers objectively recognizes a judgment that the law's "theoretical field" is above the law's "practical field."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The fact is that some experts and scholars who are engaged in researching and teaching of pure legal theory, such as history of the legal system and international law, do not fit with practical law regardless of their depth of theoretical attainment.</seg>
<seg id="9"> In this way, for the law's "practical field," the "specially licensed lawyer system" no doubt opens a "bad door" which very negatively influences chaos in qualifications.</seg>
<seg id="10"> This is not the only blind belief about the "theoretical field."  The phenomenon of expert opinions and expert panel discussions frequently influencing and even overruling court rulings is another direct manifestation of this kind of blind belief.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> When out on a trip, one wants to feel relaxed, refreshed, and free, enjoying to the utmost the fruits of natural scenery and society's civilization.</seg>
<seg id="3"> However, many people encounter this kind of vexation when traveling domestically: being chased and intercepted by peddlers and middlemen in public places.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Whether on autos or trains, boarding or alighting, there are constant entanglements with small peddlers and some unlicensed middlemen.</seg>
<seg id="5"> If they are not selling eggs, peanuts, or sesame seed cakes, they are selling newspapers and magazines.  There are also many unlicensed middlemen introducing restaurants and hotels, even peddling fake certificates and fake receipts, among other things.</seg>
<seg id="6"> If you do not accept, he can chase you for a few hundred meters, like someone ready to die for a just cause in the face of failure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> At some scenic spots, many tourists also have the same feeling.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Prior to entering the main gate, people come to peddle things like travel souvenirs and small crafts.</seg>
<seg id="9"> After entering, there is more of this kind of situation.  No matter how good your mood, you will be bothered to the point of losing interest.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Media have reported that many foreign tourists in Xi'an sing endless praise for the scenic spots and historic sites of Xi'an, but cannot understand why masses of small peddlers and hawkers are allowed to sell everywhere.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Public places including bus stations and scenic spots are at root places for trips and relaxation.  They should be civilized, orderly, quiet, harmonious, providing tourists a comfortable and relaxed environment.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Peddlers' freedom to come and go not only affects the mood of tourists, it also destroys the public order of these public places on an objective level, bringing about visual pollution and environmental pollution.  At the same time, it also gives lawless people the condition and opportunity for creating trouble.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The important thing is, these public places are windows onto the development of local spiritual civilization.  One can deduce much from little information.  It is not only the image that suffers, as local economic development will be influenced as well.</seg>
<seg id="14"> Just think, you want to make the tourism industry bigger and stronger, but use this kind of chaotic tourism environment to welcome guests from near and far.  Who still wants to come?  Who dares to come?</seg>
<seg id="15"> How can your tourism economy obtain beneficial results?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> With the coming of the peak travel season, it should be said that creating a civilized travel environment for tourists from near and far is an urgent matter.</seg>
<seg id="17"> Public places are not markets.  The operating behavior of small peddlers and hawkers should be standardized.  Put a firm stop to unlicensed operations, staunchly crack down on illegal activities.</seg>
<seg id="18"> Only a civilized and orderly environment can let tourists come happily, leave satisfied, and return with excitement.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> In short, do not let peddlers spoil public places.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The Jianguomen neighborhood in Dongcheng District, Beijing, gave items such as refrigerators as a reward to 12 poor families who exited from subsistence allowances on their own initiative.</seg>
<seg id="3"> (Beijing News, July 10)</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> This writer feels happy for the improved lives of these families, but has mixed feelings about the phrase "self-initiated exit from subsistence allowances," and the practice of "giving rewards."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> An assistant director of the Jianguomen neighborhood said, "In light of problems like cheating on subsistence allowances, encouraging the self-initiated exit from subsistence allowances sets an example for other poor families."</seg>
<seg id="6"> This example is indeed worth promoting if it encourages other poor people to get out of their predicaments through one's own hard work; it is really somewhat naïve if it is thought this will "inspire" those people who have fraudulently received subsistence allowances for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="7"> When differentiating and straightening out real and fake poor families, what should be relied on more is the law.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Relevant departments should strengthen the obligations that must be met for poor families to enjoy subsistence allowances: such as immediately reporting changes in family members' incomes, reporting employment situation, and accepting regular reviews.  Meanwhile, relevant departments should increase the strength of supervision and investigation.</seg>
<seg id="9"> In the end, "exit from subsistence allowance according to the law" is the long-term solution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Who pays when the neighborhood gives material rewards to families who exit from subsistence allowance?</seg>
<seg id="11"> As a first-level governmental organization, a neighborhood has its expenses covered by financial allocations.</seg>
<seg id="12"> However, should this taxpayer money be spent?</seg>
<seg id="13"> On the one hand, families who exit from subsistence allowances prove that they already have a certain "self-sufficient" capacity; on the other hand, aren't there still people who are applying for subsistence allowances?</seg>
<seg id="14"> Government financial allocations, which is called a lifeline, should provide timely help rather than reward good fortune.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> On July 10, Chengdu City Xindu District Mulan Town Party Committee Secretary Liu Gangyi, the first town party committee secretary in the country to be directly elected by the public, received his fourth review since taking office, achieving a satisfaction rate of 97%.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Liu Gangyi positioned himself as a "service provider" during a conversation between this correspondent and Liu Gangyi.</seg>
<seg id="4"> (Yesterday, Beijing News)</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> "Service provider" in the words of Liu Gangyi may be more real, more convincing than "service provider" in the words of some appointed cadres.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The biggest advantage of being directly elected by the public compared to appointment is that for the former, determination of power mainly originates with ordinary party members and the public, whereas for the latter, nominations are mainly by superior organizations.  Therefore, direction of the power source determines that with the former, responsibility to the public must be given top priority.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The source of power, and to whom one owes responsibility, are basic elements that determine how elected people carry out their work.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Some people question whether such "democratic review" is more like a "democracy show."</seg>
<seg id="9"> My opinion is, having this kind of "democratic review" format is better than nothing.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Considering the history and current situation of China's grassroots democratic political development, I think direct election by the public is already a major breakthrough.  Democratic review is an important component of this pioneering work, and should not be underestimated in promoting grassroots democratic political development.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> On June 23, Patil clasped her hands together before filling out the presidential candidate documents.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> India's presidential election kicked off on the 19th, with the new president to be elected from between Shekhawat, the current vice president, and Pratibha Patil, the recently resigned governor of Rajasthan state.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Patil is the first female presidential candidate in the history of India.  If she is elected, she will become the first female president in India's history.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Patil is the presidential candidate for the governing Congress Party, whereas Shekhawat comes from the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Since the Congress Party has an advantage in the presidential electoral college, the media and public largely guess that the possibility of a Patil victory is higher.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Patil, who is 72 years old this year, was Rajasthan's female governor.</seg>
<seg id="8"> She started out as a lawyer, entering parliament in 1985.  With abundant political work experience, she received high opinions from the government when governor of Rajasthan.</seg>
<seg id="9"> She has also dedicated herself for social welfare, as honorary chairwoman for many cultural, educational, and social welfare organizations.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Analysts note that Patil became a candidate as a result of her unswerving loyalty to Sonia Ghandi, president of India's Congress Party.</seg>
<seg id="11"> In India, the Ghandi family has been controlling the governing Congress Party for a long time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Patil has received many female voters' support.  Female voters believe that in India where there is a strong concept of discrimination against women, Patil will remold the image of women and raise the status of women.</seg>

<seg id="13"> The constitution stipulates that the president of India, a federal country, is the country's leader and commander-in-chief of the armed forces in name, without representing any party or organization.  It is more of a symbol.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> From this year, every department in each region of Guangxi has launched a campaign to change the working style of cadres and intensify construction of administrative efficiency in its organizations.  It implements "three systems:" the initial enquiry responsibility system, the handling formalities within time limits system, and the responsibility accountability system.  The key examination and approval departments affiliated to 33 autonomous regions and 135 positions of responsibility were brought into the administrative efficiency supervision work network.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Up until now, 619 people have been called to account.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> On the 5th, this correspondent learned from the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Committee for Discipline Inspection that at present Guangxi has preliminarily formed a three tier, autonomous region, municipal and county administrative efficiency inspection work network to intensify supervision of the key departments and positions of responsibility.  An electronic monitoring system of 14 cities has been fully implemented in the autonomous region's network.</seg>
<seg id="5"> The autonomous region administrative efficiency electronic inspection system connects directly to the key examination and approval departments affiliated to 33 autonomous regions and 135 positions of responsibility that deal with the investment environment and the life and work of the people.  This has further standardized the conducting of examinations and approvals, as well as improved its efficiency.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> At the same time, all levels of discipline inspection and monitoring organizations in Guangxi are strictly investigating and dealing with cases involving work style and efficiency, and damage to the public interest.  Up until now, a total of 1104 cases have been verified and investigation results for 769 cases have been finalized; 584 work units and 619 people have been called to account.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Member of the standing committee of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Party Committee and Discipline Inspection Committee Secretary Ma Tieshan said on the 5th that administrative efficiency inspection is an item of work that will always remain concomitant with administrative activities and must be progressively formed into a longstanding and effective mechanism.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Guangxi must further perfect and standardize codes of practice for each item of administrative management, build a complete administrative efficiency monitoring work system and safeguarding mechanism, and bring efficiency monitoring on track of systemization and standardization.  It must further regulate monitoring and inspection procedures, build a complete complaint handling and performance efficiency evaluation and assessment mechanism, and significantly increase accountability efforts by using a strict accountability system to ensure that the initial enquiry responsibility system, the handling formalities within time limits system and other work systems are put fully into practice.</seg>

<seg id="1"> If You Start Well, You Should Finish Well</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Simply speaking from the match result, a 2-2 score is reasonable and is also acceptable to the Chinese team.  The key is that the match itself left people feeling somewhat disappointed.</seg>
<seg id="3"> If Iran was in the lead 2-0 and then China came back to even the score, the impression given to Chinese fans would definitely be different and morale would have lifted a lot.  What a pity that the situation was exactly the opposite.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> One could say that starting well and being unable to finish well is an old problem for the Chinese team.</seg>
<seg id="5"> The Chinese team often plays poor soccer when their situation is extremely favorable, and the view of the average person is that the Chinese players are mentally not strong enough.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Indeed, this is one of the reasons China is incapable of "finishing well."</seg>
<seg id="7"> However, looking at China's match tonight, this does not necessarily seem to be the case.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Not mentioning Sun Jihai, Sun Xiang, Shao Jiayi, Zhen Zhi and others who played soccer in Europe before, Li Weifeng and others are also old war veterans.  They have extensive experience and, logically speaking, should not have any problems pschologically.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Regretfully, this Chinese team was held to a draw by Iran, and I am afraid that the reason was ineffective deployment of troops in the course of a battle.</seg>
<seg id="10"> While lagging behind, Iran substituted two people, and the scene immediately improved.</seg>
<seg id="11"> China also substituted three players in the second half, but the result was not good.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> To overcome the old problem of starting well and being unable to finish well, they must correctly determine the source of the problem.</seg>
<seg id="13"> As long as the problem can be correctly determined, it should not be hard to find a way to remove the problem.</seg>
<seg id="14"> What they really should fear is acting blindly out of desperation.</seg>
<seg id="15"> If they continue this way, no matter how many matches the Chinese team play, they will continue to repeat their old problem.  This is a far cry from everyone's expectation to see them improve with each match they play.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, London, July 2 - Icelandic scientists discovered through research that people with mutation in two types of gene in the body have a far greater risk of getting afflicted with atrial fibrillation than the average person.</seg>
<seg id="3"> According to a report in the latest issue of Nature magazine, after screening the genes of several thousand people from Iceland, Sweden, the US, and the Hong Kong region of China, researchers at Iceland's deCODE Genetics Company made the above discovery.</seg>
<seg id="4"> These two types of gene discovered by scientists are located near that of a type of gene that plays an important role in the early stages of heart development.</seg>
<seg id="5"> AF, i.e. atrial fibrillation, is clinically one of the most commonly seen cardiac arrhythmias and can give rise to heart palpitations, shortness of breath, tiredness and sudden stroke.</seg>
<seg id="6"> In addition, according to a report in Nature Genetics magazine published on the 1st, researchers at deCODE Genetics Company also discovered two types of gene on human chromosome 17 correlating to prostate cancer morbidity.  They exert some kind of effect in more than one third of prostate cancer cases.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Research also discovered that while increasing the risk of people getting afflicted with prostate cancer, one of the genes also decreases the risk of getting afflicted with Type II diabetes.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Maracaibo (Venezuela), July 3 (Correspondent Liu Jian)</seg>
<seg id="3"> According to a Venezuelan media report on the third, US team's 37-year-old veteran goalkeeper Keller said in an interview here that if he is unable to find a suitable club to serve after the America Cup, then he will choose retirement.</seg>
<seg id="4"> "If I am still unable to obtain a one to two season contract in a high level league team four to six weeks after the America Cup ends, then perhaps retirement is not a bad option for me."</seg>
<seg id="5"> With Munchen-Gladbach falling to the German Bundesliga 2, Keller also left this team which he served for more than two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Although Keller is considering turning in his gloves, he obviously has more than enough suitors who are interested in him.  He spoke candidly that at present, as many as eight teams are interested in inviting him to join them,</seg>
<seg id="7"> yet this veteran goalkeeping idol, who has served in the Spanish Primera League, the English Premier Division, and German Bundesliga 1, expressed that how he finally decides, depends upon his family, "My child is already 9 years old, he has stayed with me in three different countries and gone to three different schools.  My choice now must consider how to better benefit my family."</seg>
<seg id="8"> In the Gold Cup that ended not long ago, Keller performed outstandingly and helped the US team capture the championship.</seg>
<seg id="9"> In the current America Cup, he was still entrusted with the important task by head coach Bradley, but what can one man do against overwhelming odds; a US team of "Elite Young Guards" setting out to do battle is fundamentally no rival for such South American giants as Argentina and Paraguay.  In these two matches, the goal he guarded was penetrated 7 times.</seg>
<seg id="10"> The next match, paired up against Columbia, is very likely to be the US team's and Keller's final performance in the current America Cup.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Beijing time yesterday, an extraordinary hearing held by the FIA World Motor Sport Council on the Ferrari technical spy case ended in Paris, where the summoned McLaren team escaped a disaster: the council decided not to penalize McLaren for the moment.</seg>
<seg id="3"> The FIA official website issued a statement following the hearing, which says, "the Vodafone McLaren Mercedes team was in possession of confidential Ferrari information, but presently there is insufficient evidence that this information was used improperly in the FIA Formula One World Championship. Therefore, no penalty is imposed."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> However, the Ferrari technical spy case did not come to an end at this point.</seg>
<seg id="5"> The WMSC also said in the decision, "if it is found in the future that relevant Ferrari information has been used to the detriment of the championship, we reserve the right to request the McLaren team back to a hearing of the WMSC where it may face the penalty of being excluded from not only the 2007 season but also the 2008 season."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Mike Coughlan, the suspended former McLaren chief designer, was found to possess a nearly 800-page Ferrari technical dossier, which covered a series of aspects of Ferrari 2007 racers, including design, power, construction, examination, test, development and running.</seg>
<seg id="7"> McLaren insisted that no one else in the team knew about the dossier before Coughlan was suspended, and McLaren racers this season contained no Ferrari elements.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> July 30 chinanews.com</seg>
<seg id="3"> According to a report in the China Securities, with the introduction of the Interim Regulations Governing Overseas Investment of Insurance Capitals the other day, insurance capitals have broader room to take advantage of the capital market.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Liu Lefei, Chief Investment Officer of China Life Co., Ltd, believes that due to the appreciation of RMB and promising domestic capital market, insurance institutions will not invest overseas by buying foreign currencies on a large scale in the short run, which means insurance QDII will not drain cash from the domestic stock market anytime soon.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The report says quite a few insurance institutions hold the same view.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Experts say in the absence of a derivatives market for RMB, insurance institutions lack sufficient hedging measures. It is therefore not yet time to buy foreign currencies on a large scale.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Liu Lefei said that in the long run, in terms of asset allocation, overseas investment should have some weight in the overall allocation of insurance companies.</seg>
<seg id="8"> However, given the fairly large upward pressure of RMB at present, China Life will primarily use its own foreign reserves for overseas investment.</seg>
<seg id="9"> As for investing overseas by buying foreign currencies, caution should be taken under the current circumstances.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> July 31 chinanews.com - Chen Shui-bian on the 30th questioned the island's judicial personnel for intervention into the leadership elections of the Taiwan region.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Kao Chin-chih, "Director-General of the Department of Judicial Administration at the Judicial Yuan" of Taiwan said on the same day that the current behaviors of judges on the island were inconsistent with what Chen Shui-bian said, and he demanded that Chen Shui-bian explain his comments.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> According to a report in Taiwan's United Daily, Chen Shui-bian on the 30th questioned judges, prosecutors and investigators for intervening, influencing or even attempting to manipulate election campaigns of candidates from different parties out of political factors or election considerations and said he hoped the phenomenon did not exist in Taiwan, but it might be very difficult.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> In response to Chen Shui-bian's questioning, President of Taiwan "Judicial Yuan" Weng Yueh-sheng kept a low key with no responses, while "Secretary-General" Fan Kuang-chun appointed Kao Chin-chih to speak on behalf of the "Judicial Yuan."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Kao Chin-chih said both the fundamental law of Taiwan and "Judges Code of Conduct" state explicitly that judges should stay beyond parties and must not participate in party activities or assist with election campaigns; all judges have carefully observed relevant restrictions and the "Judicial Yuan" believes all judges are behaving very well.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Kao Chin-chih noted by giving an example, when Judge Jang Shenq-shii of Kaohsiung "Branch High Court" attended a program at the Ketagalan Institute several years ago, he was immediately decided to be punished by the self-regulation panel comprised of judges due to the partisan tint of relevant courses.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Jang Shenq-shii once wanted to run in the primary for the Progressive Party but eventually decided to quit, again amid controversy over his participation while in office.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Kao Chin-chih believes if it is the trial of an individual case, there is recourse to the appeal process. One should not infer the judge has ulterior political motives solely based on the result of the ruling.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Don't Worship Legal "Theorists" Blindly</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> It is stipulated in Article 8 of the Draft Amendment to the Attorneys Law recently submitted to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress for review that those who apply for practicing as an attorney and have senior professional designations or equivalent professional levels from previous professional work such as legal research and teaching, can be permitted to practice as a lawyer upon approval of the justice department of the State Council.</seg>
<seg id="3"> (June 28, China Youth Daily)</seg>
<seg id="4"> There are "theorists" and "practitioners" in law, where the former primarily involve "abstract behaviors" such as legal teaching and research, while the latter are more of "concrete behaviors" such as litigations, legal counseling and legal services.</seg>
<seg id="5"> For a long time, there has been mutual contempt between legal "theorists" and "practitioners." "Theorists" think "practitioners" are merely mechanical "legal dogmatists" lacking necessary attainments in the science of law, while criticisms of "practitioners" about "theorists" are directed at the "inability of theories to guide practice."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Given such gap in the division of labor, what law can do is to remain neutral rather than strongly support either of the two.</seg>
<seg id="7"> However, the "chartered attorney system" in the Attorneys Law recognizes the opinion factually that legal "theorists" are superior to legal "practitioners."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> In reality, for some experts and scholars who study and teach pure legal theories such as the legal history and international law, no matter how profound and sophisticated their theories are, they are incompatible with legal practice.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Thus, the "chartered attorney system" has undoubtedly created a "bad opening" to confusions in legal "practitioner" qualifications, which has extremely adverse influence.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Blind worship of "theorists" does not stop here. Phenomena where reports of expert opinions and expert argumentation seminars often affect and even override court verdicts are also direct reflections of such blind worship.</seg>

<seg id="3"> The reporter learned from a press conference of the State Council Information Office that beginning July 1 this year, China would implement an ad hoc tax-free registration policy for Chinese-funded vessels engaged in international shipping to encourage Chinese-funded ships flying foreign flags to register back in China, acquire the PRC nationality and operate under the Five-Starred Red Flag.</seg>
<seg id="4"> To further promote sound development of our nation's maritime industry and expand the national fleet, in response to relevant problems arising from the significant number of our vessels engaged in international voyages that register overseas and operate under foreign flags, the Ministry of Communications recently issued an Announcement on Implementing Ad Hoc Tax-Free Registration Policy for Chinese-Funded Vessels Engaged in International Shipping, which specifies the conditions and application procedures of enjoying the ad hoc tax-free registration policy. Eligible vessels are exempt from customs duty and import VAT if they submit import declarations within two years beginning July 1 this year.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Traveling away from home, the aim is to be relaxed, refreshed and comfortable and to enjoy natural scenery and the achievements of social civilization to the maximum extent.</seg>
<seg id="3"> However, when traveling domestically, many people have experienced such annoyance, which is being blocked in public places by peddlers and those doing agent businesses.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> No matter in a bus or a train, they are always persistently harassed by peddlers and illegal agents whenever getting on or off the vehicle.</seg>
<seg id="5"> If they are not selling eggs, peanuts or pies, then they are selling newspapers or magazines. Others are a large number of illegal agents who recommend restaurants or accommodations, or even peddle fake invoices.</seg>
<seg id="6"> If you don't accept, they may follow you several hundred meters, quite an air of I would rather die if I don't succeed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> At some scenic spots, many tourists feel the same way.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Before you even enter the gate, there will be someone peddling things like tourist souvenirs and small crafts.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Once you enter, there will be even more such things. Even the best mood will be dispelled.</seg>
<seg id="10"> A media agency once reported that while many foreign tourists to Xi'an were amazed by the famous and historic sites in Xi'an, they felt perplexed by piles of vendors and peddlers selling goods everywhere.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Public places like bus stops and scenic spots are supposed to be places for traveling and relaxing, where courtesy, order, quietness and harmony should prevail, so as to give tourists a comfortable and easy environment.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Free entry and exit of peddlers not only disturb tourists' moods, but also virtually destruct the public order at these public places, thus creating visual pollution and environmental pollution. In addition, it also provides conditions and opportunities for lawbreakers to stir up troubles.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> What's important is that these public places are the window showcasing local cultural and ideological progress. Seeing a spot reveals the whole picture. What is damaged is not only a question of image, but it will also affect local economic development.</seg>
<seg id="14"> Just imagine, you want to make your tourism industry big and strong, but use such messy tourist environment to greet guests from around the world. Who will want to come, and who will dare to come?</seg>
<seg id="15"> Then, how does your tourism economy yield any benefits?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> With the high season coming for tourism, it should be a priority to create a civilized tourism environment for tourists from all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="17"> Public places are not markets. Business activities of vendors and peddlers should be regulated. Those who operate without a license should be firmly removed, and illegal activities should be firmly suppressed.</seg>
<seg id="18"> Only a civilized and orderly environment will make tourists come, go and return gladly.</seg>
</p>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> By giving away things like refrigerators, the Jianguomen subdistrict of Beijing's Dongcheng district has awarded 12 households enjoying the minimum living allowance for opting out of the minimum living standard scheme.</seg>
<seg id="3"> (The Beijing News - July 10)</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The author is happy for these households for the improvement in their living, but has mixed feelings towards the term "opting out of the minimum living standard scheme" and the practice of "awarding."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> "Regarding problems such as cheating on the minimum living allowance, encouraging people to opt out of the minimum living standard scheme is to set examples for other households enjoying the minimum living allowances," Deputy Director at the Jianguomen Subdistrict Office said.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Such examples are indeed worth promoting if they are to encourage other people enjoying the minimum living allowance to get out of difficulties through their own efforts; they are, however, a bit naive if the purpose is to "move" those who have cheated on the minimum living allowance for long.</seg>
<seg id="7"> In distinguishing between and cleaning up real and fake households entitled to the minimum living allowance, what should be relied on more is the law.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Competent authorities should highlight the obligations of households entitled to the minimum living allowance while they enjoy the minimum living standard allowance: for example, informing of changes in family members and income in a timely manner, reporting the employment situation, undergoing regular reviews etc. And competent authorities should intensify supervision and inspection.</seg>
<seg id="9"> After all, "withdrawal from the minimum living standard scheme pursuant to law" is the permanent solution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Who will pay for the in-kind rewards given by the subdistrict to the households who opt out of the minimum living standard scheme?</seg>
<seg id="11"> As a level of governmental organizations, the spending of a subdistrict is covered by fiscal allocation.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Yet should this money of the taxpayers be spent?</seg>
<seg id="13"> On the one hand, by opting out of the minimum living standard scheme, the households prove to have certain capacity to "sustain themselves;" on the other hand, aren't there still people claiming the minimum living standard allowance?</seg>
<seg id="14"> The government's fiscal allocation that is dubbed life-saving money should provide timely assistance rather than add icing to a cake.</seg>

<seg id="4"> (The Beijing News - a day ago)</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The "servant" uttered by Liu Gangyi may be more real and convincing than the "servant" uttered by those appointed officials.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The biggest advantage of public nomination and direct election, compared with the mechanism of appointment, is that with the former, the source of authority is primarily decided by average party members and commoners, while the latter are appointed by a higher organizational level. And the direction of the source of authority determines the former must place their responsibility for the public at the top.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The source of authority and who to report to are the fundamental factors that decide how the elected go about their work.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Some people question such "democratic assessment," saying it is more like a "show of democracy."</seg>
<seg id="9"> My view is that it is better to have this form of "democratic assessment" than nothing.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Considering the history and current situation of the grassroot democracy progress in China, I believe public nomination and direct election are already a major breakthrough. As an important part of this innovation, democratic assessment should not be underestimated in advancing the grassroot democracy progress.</seg>

<seg id="2"> BEIJING, July 13, by the newspaper (Yang Jinbao and Reporter Liu Xinxin) The entire armed forces will gradually switch over to Type 07 military uniforms starting from August 1.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Tonight, China Military Online has specially invited Chen Jun, Deputy Director of the Clothing and Equipment Office of the Military Supplies and POL Section of the General Logistics Department, and Su Yang, senior engineer at the Quartermaster Equipment Institute of the General Logistics Department and one of the designers of Type 07 military uniforms, to China Military Online, to chat with net buddies in and outside the military about the story behind the birth of the new military uniforms and their development process, which was well responded among netizens.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The two guests were direct participants in the design and development of Type 07 military uniforms.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Speaking of changes in the new military uniforms, they revealed that the Type 07 military uniforms were designed on the basis of historical uniform upgrades, especially the Type 97 military uniforms, with as many as several hundred refinements in seven aspects, including the series, designs and styles of the military uniforms.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The biggest feature of Type 07 military uniforms is that they reflect the demands for serialization, functionality and humanization, which for the first time enables our army to meet the standards of harmonization among the three armed forces, having a complete range of items and having a series of accessories, marking a historical leap forward in the level of military uniform development of our army.</seg>

<seg id="1"> A Good Start Calls for a Good Ending</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Solely from the result of the game, a score of 2-2 is reasonable and also acceptable to the Chinese team. What's essential is the process of the game, which is somewhat disappointing.</seg>
<seg id="3"> If it was the Iranian team who led 2-0 before the Chinese team equalized the score, this would definitely give Chinese soccer fans different feelings and significantly boost morale. Unfortunately, things were just the opposite.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> A good start without a good ending could be said a chronic problem of the Chinese team.</seg>
<seg id="5"> The Chinese team often does not know how to play soccer under favorable circumstances. The conventional view is that Chinese players have less than satisfactory psychological quality.</seg>
<seg id="6"> This is indeed a reason why the Chinese team could not have a "good ending."</seg>
<seg id="7"> However, seen from today's game of the Chinese team, it seems this is not completely true.</seg>
<seg id="8"> People like Li Weifeng are experienced veteran players, let alone people like Sun Jihai, Sun Xiang, Shao Jiayi and Zheng Zhi who have played soccer in Europe. They have broad experience and knowledge, and should not have problematic psychological quality logically speaking.</seg>
<seg id="9"> The Chinese team was unfortunately forced into a draw by the Iranian team this time, most probably because of improper deployment of players.</seg>
<seg id="10"> The Iranian team substituted with two people while trailing behind and the situation improved instantly.</seg>
<seg id="11"> The Chinese team also substituted with three players, but the result was not good.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> To overcome the problem of having a good start without a good ending, the source of the problem must be spotted.</seg>
<seg id="13"> As long as the problem is spotted, it may not be difficult to find a solution to redress the problem.</seg>
<seg id="14"> What we fear is to see a doctor indiscriminately in case of an emergency disease.</seg>
<seg id="15"> If things go on like that, the chronic problem will persist no matter how many games the Chinese team plays, not to mention a step forward in each game that people expect.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> MARACAIBO (Venezuela), July 3, Xinhua (Reporter Liu Jian)</seg>
<seg id="3"> According to reports of the Venezuelan media on the 3rd, 37-year old US veteran goalkeeper Keller said in an interview here that he would choose to retire if he couldn't find an appropriate club to play for after Copa America.</seg>
<seg id="4"> "If in four to six weeks after Copa America I'm still unable to secure a contract for one or two seasons in a high-level league club, then retirement may not be a bad choice for me.</seg>
<seg id="5"> "With Monchengladbach relegated to Germany's second division, Keller left the team for which he played for more than two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Although Keller has the intention to stop, he, "still waiting for a boss at home," apparently doesn't have to worry about his next employment. He admitted that up to eight teams had made offers for him to join so far.</seg>
<seg id="7"> However, the veteran goalkeeper who has played in the Primera división de Liga, English Premier League and Bundesliga, said how he would choose finally would depend on his family, "my child is already nine years old and he has been in three different countries and three different schools with me. My choice now will consider what is better for my family."</seg>
<seg id="8"> In the Gold Cup that ended not long ago, Keller helped the US team win the title with outstanding performance.</seg>
<seg id="9"> During this year's Copa America, while he was again entrusted with an important task by Head Coach Bradley, nevertheless he could hardly resist so many players with a single fist. The US team, embarking on the expedition as the "young guards," was not at all rivals of such strong South American teams as Argentina and Paraguay. In two matches, the goal he kept was broken seven times.</seg>
<seg id="10"> The next match against the Colombian team may well be the last performance of the US team and Keller in this year's Copa America.</seg>

<seg id="1"> US Treasury Secretary Arrives in China to Visit, Environmental Protection and Exchange Rate As Key Concerns</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> U.S. Treasury Secretary Paulson arrived in China yesterday for a visit. The United States is exerting all efforts in convincing China to further implement necessary economic reforms and environmental protection work, particularly the Renminbi exchange rate topic that had attracted wide attention.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> U.S. diplomat stated that Paulson visited Xining City, the capital of major Chinese northwestern province Qinghai, earlier.</seg>
<seg id="4"> China is currently implementing a series of environmental protection plans near the largest salt-water lake in Qinghai Province.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Paulson traveled to Beijing today to discuss with chief Chinese officials on topics including the acceleration of the process of the 'US-China Strategic Economic Dialogue' initiated last year.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The US-China Strategic Economic Dialogue mainly discusses economic and environmental protection issues with Renminbi exchange rate being the most important one. U.S. congressmen argued that the value of Renminbi is underestimated.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The US-China trade deficit is soaring. Pressure inside the United States is increasing. Congressmen are preparing to adopt retaliatory measures to counter their so-called "unfair China trade policy".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Last week, the U.S. Senate Finance Committee overwhelmingly adopted a bill requiring the Treasury Department to identify list of nations with "fundamentally misaligned" currency exchange rate, thus opening a potential door to economic sanctions against Beijing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> U.S. congressmen said that an undervalued Renminbi makes goods exported from China to the United States very inexpensive, thus intensifying the US-China trade deficit. The US-China trade deficit had reached US $ 232500000000 last year.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The special hearing held by the World Motor Sport Council for the Ferrari technology espionage case ended in Paris last night Beijing time. McLaren, the racing team being summoned, escaped misfortune: The council decided not to penalize McLaren racecar team for the time being.</seg>
<seg id="3"> The official website of the World Motor Sport Council published a declaration after the hearing that said, "Vodafone McLaren Mercedes was in possession of confidential Ferrari information. However, there is insufficient evidence that this information was used in such a way as to interfere improperly with the FIA Formula One World Championship. We therefore impose no penalty."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Nonetheless, the Ferrari technology espionage case did not end here.</seg>
<seg id="5"> The World Motor Sport Council also stated in the decision, ""But if it is found in the future that the Ferrari information has been used to the detriment of the championship, we reserve the right to invite Vodafone McLaren Mercedes back in front of the WMSC where it will face the possibility of exclusion from not only the 2007 championship but also the 2008 championship."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Mike Coughlan, former chief designer of McLaren who has now been terminated, was found to possess nearly 800 pages of Ferrari technical dossier containing a whole set of interconnections including the design, power, building, inspection, testing, development, and running of the 2007 Ferrari race cars.</seg>
<seg id="7"> McLaren insisted that before Coughlan was terminated, no one else in the racecar team had known about this information and that there is no Ferrari's elements in the racecars of McLaren this season.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Chinanews.com, July 30</seg>
<seg id="3"> According to report of China Securities, the Interim Administrative Measures for the Management of Offshore Investments of Insurance Funds was promulgated a few days ago. Insurance funds thus have wider room for utilization in the capital market.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Liu Lefei, Chief Investment Officer at China Life Insurance, believed that with the appreciation of the Renminbi and the strong domestic capital market, insurance institutions will not engage in large-scale offshore investments through foreign exchange purchase. This also implies that the Insurance QDII will not divert funds in domestic stock market in the near future.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The report stated that many insurance institutions shared the same view.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Expert stated that since a Renminbi derivative market still does not exist at the present moment, insurance institutions do not have adequate measures to avert risk. Therefore, conditions are not yet ripe for large-scale foreign exchange purchase.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Liu Lefei said that in the long run, in the area of asset allocation, offshore investments should make up a considerable portion in the overall allocation of insurance companies.</seg>
<seg id="8"> However, since the Renminbi has rather huge appreciation pressure at present, China Life Insurance will mainly utilize exchange funds that it has in offshore investments.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Caution should be given to the purchase of foreign exchange for offshore investments under current situation.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Chinanews.com, July 31 - Chen Shui-bian on the 30th raised doubts about attempts of judicial members in the island to intervene in the election of Taiwan regional leaders.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Kao Chin-chih, "Director-General of the Department of Judicial Administration" in Taiwan, stated on the same day that judges in the island are behaving differently from what Chen Shui-bian described and demanded an explanation from Chen Shui-bian for his remark.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> According to report of the United Daily News of Taiwan, Chen Shui-bian raised doubts about judges, prosecutors, and investigators intervened, influenced, and even attempted to control the election campaigns of various party candidates out of political factors or consideration for the elections. He claimed that he hoped this situation does not exist in Taiwan but it may be extremely difficult.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> In response to the doubt of Chen Shui-bian, Weng Yueh-sheng, "President of the Judicial Yuan" in Taiwan maintained a low-key and did not respond while "Secretary-General" Fan Kuang-chun appointed Kao Chin-chih to speak for the Judicial Yuan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Kao Chin-chih stated that the Fundamental Law of Taiwan and the "judges' rules and regulations" both proclaim in explicit terms that judges should transcend political parties and groups. They cannot participate in activities of political parties or assist in the campaign. Judges all follow relevant restraints cautiously. The Judicial Yuan believed that all judges have done well.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Kao Chin-chih quoted an example by saying that Chang Sheng-hsi, judge of the "Kaohsiung Branch of the Supreme Court", took part in the course offered by the Ketagalan Institute a few years ago. Since the related course had party flavor, the self-disciplinary committee formed by judges decided to take disciplinary action against him.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Chang Sheng-hsi once wanted to run in the primary election of the Democratic Progressive Party but due to the controversy over running in the election while in office, he finally decided to give up.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Kao Chin-chih argued that if it is for the trial of individual case, one can lodge an appeal to the court of higher instance. One cannot infer that judges have other political intentions solely based on the outcome of the verdict.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Don't Have Blind Faith in Legal "Theoretical Circle"</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Article 8 of the draft amendment of the Law on Lawyers recently submitted to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress for deliberation stipulates: people who have professional experiences in the research or teaching of law, with advanced professional titles or corresponding professional competence, may obtain a lawyer's license, and get approval from judicial departments under the State Council.</seg>
<seg id="3"> (June 28, China Youth Daily)</seg>
<seg id="4"> There is a difference between the "theoretical circle" and the "practical circle" in law. The former mainly includes "abstract behaviors" such as the teaching and research of law while the latter are more "concrete behaviors" such as engaging in litigations, legal consultations, and legal services.</seg>
<seg id="5"> The phenomenon of "scorning of each other" has long existed between the theoretical circle and the practical circle in law. The theoretical circle argues that the practical circle lacks necessary legal attainments and is simply mechanical "legalist" while the direction of criticism of the practical circle on the theoretical circle is that "theories cannot guide practice".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> In regards to such a divergence of division of labor, what law can do is to remain neutral instead of supporting any one side with mightiness.</seg>
<seg id="7"> However, the "chartered lawyer system" in the Law on Lawyers has objectively endorsed the judgment that the theoretical circle is superior to the practical circle in law.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> In fact, for some experts and scholars who engage in pure research and teaching of legal theories such as the history of legal system and international laws, no matter how thoroughly accomplished they are in theories, they will still be out of step with practical legal issues.</seg>
<seg id="9"> In this case, chartered lawyer system has no doubt set a "bad precedent" with extremely harmful effects on the qualification confusion in the practical circle in law.</seg>
<seg id="10"> The blind faith in the theoretical circle is not only limited to these. For instance, expert submissions and expert appraisal meetings always influence and even veto court verdicts. This phenomenon is also a direct manifestation of such blind faith.</seg>

<seg id="3"> However, when traveling in China, many people encounter such an annoyance of being encircled, pursued, obstructed, and intercepted by peddlers and people engage in intermediary businesses in public places.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> When people getting on or off the vehicle, no matter car or train, they are always pestered by peddlers and some unlicensed middlemen.</seg>
<seg id="5"> If they are not selling eggs, peanuts, and sesame seed cakes, then they are selling newspapers and magazines, and then the many unlicensed middlemen recommending restaurants and hotels, and even selling fake documents and fake invoices so on and so forth.</seg>
<seg id="6"> If you turn him down, he can follow you for a few hundred meters and act very much like to win or die.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="7"> Many visitors also feel the same in some scenic spots.</seg>
<seg id="8"> People come to peddle things such as travel souvenirs and small handicrafts and things like that before one enters the door.</seg>
<seg id="9"> The situation increases once one enters the door. No matter how bright one's mood is, it will still be spoiled and one will feel insipid.</seg>
<seg id="10"> The media once reported that many foreign visitors to Xi'an spoke very highly of the scenic spots and historical sites of Xi'an. However, they could not understand why heaps of peddlers were allowed to peddle everywhere.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Public places such as stations and scenic spots are originally places where journey embarks or for leisure. Good manners and order, as well as peace and harmony should be stressed to provide visitors with a comfortable and relaxing environment.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Not only does the come and go at will of the peddlers disturb visitors' mood, objectively, they have disrupted the public order of these public places and caused visual and environmental pollution, and at the same time, it also provides conditions and opportunities to lawbreakers to incite trouble.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The Jianguomen neighborhood office in Dongcheng District, Beijing handed out items such as refrigerators as rewards for 12 low-income subsidy recipient families that voluntarily  surrendered their low-income subsidies.</seg>
<seg id="3"> (The Beijing News, July 10)</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The author is happy about the improvements in life of these families. However, I have mixed feelings about the wording of "voluntary surrender of low-income subsidy" and the practice of "giving out rewards".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Vice-chairman of Jianguomen neighborhood office said, "In order to address problems including defrauding low-income subsidy and so on, encouraging voluntary surrender of low-income subsidy is to set an example for other low-income subsidy recipient households."</seg>
<seg id="6"> If this example encourages other low-income subsidy recipients to turn the corner through efforts of their own, then it is indeed worth promoting. However, if one wants to use this to "inspire" people who have been defrauding low-income subsidy for a long time, then it is somewhat naive.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The work to differentiate and straighten up real and false low-income subsidy recipient households should rely more on the law.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Relevant departments should strengthen responsibilities that low-income subsidy recipient households need to fulfill when enjoying low-income subsidy: For example, inform changes in number of family members and income in a timely manner, report employment situation, and subjected to regular review. Meanwhile, relevant departments should step up efforts in supervision and inspection.</seg>
<seg id="9"> After all, only the "surrender of low-income subsidy according to the law" is the long-term plan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Who pays for the material rewards given to families that surrender their low-income subsidies by the neighborhood office?</seg>
<seg id="11"> As a level-one government agency, the expenses of the neighborhood office are shouldered by financial appropriation.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Then, should this sum of taxpayers' money be spent?</seg>
<seg id="13"> On the one hand, families that surrender their low-income subsidies have proven that they have certain abilities to be 'self-sufficient". On the other hand, aren't there still people who apply for low-income subsidy?</seg>
<seg id="14"> Government appropriation that is labeled as life-saving money should render timely help instead of making what is good still better.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> On July 10, Liu Gangyi, the first Secretary of the township Party committee publicly nominated and directly elected in the country and the Secretary of the Party committee of Mulan Town in Xindu District, Chengdu City was subjected to democratic evaluation for the fourth time since he took office. He had an approval rating of 97 percent.</seg>
<seg id="3"> In the conversation between Liu Gangyi and the reporter, Liu Gangyi defined himself as "one who serves others".</seg>
<seg id="4"> (Yesterday, the Beijing News)</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The "one who serves others" that Liu Gangyi referred to is perhaps more truthful and convincing than "the one who serves others" referred to by some appointed cadres.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The biggest advantage of public nomination and direct election over appointment system is that it is mainly ordinary Party members and the people who determine the origin of the power of the former while the latter is mainly appointed by higher-level organizations, whereas the direction from which power originates has established that the former must give accountability to the people top priority.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The origin of power and to whom one is responsibleare fundamental factors in deciding how an electee conducts his work.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Some people challenge that such a "democratic evaluation" is more like a "democracy show".</seg>
<seg id="9"> My opinion is that having such form of democratic evaluation is better than not having any.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Given considerations to the history and current situation of the building of democratic politics at the grassroots level in China, I believe that direct public election is already a major breakthrough. Democratic evaluation is an important component of this unprecedented undertaking. It should not be underestimated in the advancement of building democratic politics at the grassroots level.</seg>

<seg id="4"> Patil is the first female presidential candidate in India's history. If she is elected, she will become India's first woman president ever.</seg>

<seg id="8"> She was a lawyer and joined the Congress in 1985. She is seasoned in politics. During her term as the governor of Rajasthan, she had received high opinions from the government.</seg>
<seg id="9"> She also devotes herself to social welfare and is the honorary chairman of many cultural, educational, and social welfare organizations.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Analysts pointed out that the reason Patil became the candidate was that she has pledged her allegiance steadfastly to Sonia Gandhi, the Chairman of the Congress Party.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> This newspaper, Beijing, July 13, Reported by Yang Baojin, Reporter Liu Xinxin: All forces of the entire army will gradually change to wear the 07 style army uniforms starting August 1.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Tonight, the China Military Online specially invited Deputy Director Chen Jun of the Clothing and Equipment Office of Military Supply and POL Section of the General Logistics Department together with Su Yang, the senior engineer at the Quartermaster Equipment Institute of the General Logistics Department and one of the designers of the 07 style army uniforms, to serve as guests of the China Military Online to discuss the background of the emergence of the new army uniforms and their development process with netizens inside and outside the army. The discussion was well received by the netizens.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The two guests were direct participants of the design and development of the 07 style army uniforms.</seg>
<seg id="5"> In their discussion on the changes of the new army uniforms, they explained that the design of the 07 style army uniforms was based on all previous uniform changes, particularly the 97 style army uniforms. Several hundred refinements had been made to seven areas including the series, system, and style of the army uniforms.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The biggest characteristic of the 07 style army uniforms is that they have manifested the requirements for serialization, functionality, and humanity, thus enable our army uniforms to reach the standards of coordination of the three services, completeness of assortment, and variety of accessories for the first time. It signifies a historical leap in the production level of our army uniforms.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The two guests also held extensive exchanges with netizens in the types, styles, sizes, and wearing of the new army uniforms.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Good Start Still Needs to See Things Through</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The 2-2 score was reasonable and was acceptable to the Chinese team if judging from the result of the game alone. The key was that the process of the game was somewhat regrettable.</seg>
<seg id="3"> If the Iranian team led by 2-0, then the Chinese team tied the score, that would definitely make Chinese fans feel very differently. It would bolster a lot of morale. Unfortunately, the situation was precisely the opposite.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Fails to see things through can be considered as an old problem of the Chinese team.</seg>
<seg id="5"> The Chinese team never knows how to play under excellent situation. The general opinion is that mentally Chinese players are not tough enough.</seg>
<seg id="6"> This is indeed a reason that the Chinese team fails to "see things through".</seg>
<seg id="7"> However, judging from the game that the Chinese team played today, it seems that it is not necessarily so.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Not only had Sun Jihai, Sun Xiang, Shao Jiayi, and Zheng Zhi played in Europe before, Li Weifeng and the others are also battle-hardened veterans. They are experienced and knowledgeable. Theoretically, there should not be any problem with their mental qualities.</seg>
<seg id="9"> This time, the Chinese team was regrettably pressed to tie with the Iranian team. The reason was probably the ineffectiveness in moving players on the field.</seg>
<seg id="10"> The Iranian team substituted two people while they were trailing behind and the situation was immediately improved.</seg>
<seg id="11"> The Chinese team also substituted three players in the second half but the outcome was not good.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> In order to overcome the problem of not seeing things through, one must find the root of the problem.</seg>
<seg id="13"> As long as one identifies the problem, means to resolve it is probably not hard to find.</seg>
<seg id="14"> The only worrisome thing is to try to find a cure indiscriminately for an emergency.</seg>
<seg id="15"> If the situation continues like this, no matter how many more games the Chinese team plays, it will still commit the same mistake. The continuous progress that people expect as it plays more games will be out of the question.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, London, July 2 - Icelandic scientists' research revealed that people who have two gene mutations in their bodies have a much higher risk of suffering from atrial fibrillation than normal people do.</seg>
<seg id="3"> According to report of the latest issue of the journal Nature, researchers of Iceland-based deCODE Genetics Inc. obtained the above finding after conducting screening of genes of several thousand people from Iceland, Sweden, the United States, and China's Hong Kong region.</seg>
<seg id="4"> The two genes discovered by the scientists are located close to a gene that plays an important role in early heart development.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Atrial fibrillation is the quivering of the heart. It is one of the most common types of clinical cardiac arrhythmia that can cause heart palpitations, shortness of breath, fatigue, and stroke.</seg>
<seg id="6"> In addition, according to report of the Nature Genetics journal published on the 1st, researchers of deCODE Genetics Inc. also identified two genes that link to prostate cancer on human chromosome 17. They play certain role in more than one third of prostate cancer cases.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Maracaibo (Venezuela), July 3 (Reporter Liu Jian)</seg>
<seg id="3"> According to report of Venezuelan media on the 3rd, during an interview here, the 37-year-old veteran goalkeeper of the U.S. team Keller stated that if he cannot find a suitable club to play for after the Copa America, then he will choose to retire.</seg>
<seg id="4"> "If four or six weeks after the Copa America ends I still can't strike a deal with a top level football team that would allow me to play another season or two then retirement may be a good choice."</seg>
<seg id="5"> With Moenchengladbach relegated to Germany's Second Division, Keller also left the team that he had played for for more than two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Even though Keller intends to retire, he, who is "yet to be married off", apparently is not worried about the next employer. He said frankly himself that currently, as many as eight clubs intend to invite him to join them.</seg>
<seg id="7"> However, the veteran goalkeeper, who had played in the Spain's First Division League, the English Premier League, and the Germany's First Division League, stated that his final decision rests on his family, "My child is nine years old already and he followed me to three different countries and studied in three different schools. My choice now must seek what's the best for my family."</seg>
<seg id="8"> In the Gold Cup Final that just ended recently, Keller had a stellar performance and helped the U.S. team won the championship.</seg>
<seg id="9"> In the Copa America this year, he was still entrusted with important task by head coach Bradley. However, one man alone cannot win. The U.S. team, which went to battle with "young guards", was simply no match for strong South American teams such as Argentina and Paraguay. The goal that he kept was penetrated seven times in two games.</seg>
<seg id="10"> The next game against the Colombian team will very probably be the last performance of the U.S. team and Keller in this year's Copa America.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Germany Plans to Lower Barriers for Bringing in Specialized Skilled Workers</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Staff report, Berlin, July 1 (Correspondent Wang Huaicheng)</seg>
<seg id="3"> German Education and Research Minister Schavan said a few days ago that Germany should lower the Immigration Law restrictions on bringing in foreign specialized skilled workers, using an introduction of foreign talent to solve Germany's specialized skilled worker shortage problems.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> According to an OECD report, by 2010, Germany's labor force between 15 and 64 years old will be shrinking yearly.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Without enough immigrants, Germany's labor force by 2020 will be 6% smaller than now.</seg>
<seg id="6"> However, reports from organizations such as the Federation of German Employers' Associations and the Association for German Engineers show that there is a relatively large shortage in the current German labor market for engineers and specialized technology workers.</seg>
<seg id="7"> According to data from the German Federal Labor Agency, the German labor market had a supply shortage of about 12700 engineers and a supply shortage of about 9600 technicians in May of this year.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Germany has set high barriers for the introduction of foreign skilled workers in order to protect local employment.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Germany's Immigration Law states that specialized skilled workers from non-EU countries cannot earn less than € 85500 per year in Germany, or else cannot obtain German work and residency permits.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Schavan proposed bringing this limit down to between 40000 and € 60000.</seg>

<seg id="1"> The Ringing of the Alarm Bell at this Moment "Connects" Hong Kong with the Rest of the World in a Joint Celebration of 10 Years Since the Handover</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> On July 1, the alarm bell at Jinghai temple memorial hall in Nanjing was once again struck and rung with a melodious resound.</seg>
<seg id="3"> This echo of profound historical significance "connected" the Mainland and Hong Kong through television; citizens of Nanjing and their fellow countrymen in Hong Kong "shared this moment with the entire world" together celebrating the 10th anniversary of Hong Kong's handover to the motherland.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> At midnight on July 1 ten years ago, the air above the bell tower at Jinghai temple memorial in Nanjing reverberated to the sounds of one hundred and fifty-five strikes of the alarm bell.  It was saying adieu to the humiliating history of the cession of Hong Kong Island.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Outside the entrance to the small memorial hall, people from all walks of society in Nanjing gathered together.  They said they will use their own two hands to strike this alarm bell, to warn themselves and later generations never to forget history.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The alarm bell is 1.842 meters high and it was in 1842 that the "Nanjing Treaty" was signed, right at the time the Opium War broke out.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The shoulder of the bell is 1.997 meters high and 1997 is the year of the Hong Kong handover.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The planner and founder of the alarm bell that year, Wang Fengling, explained, "Five rows of the character '10000' encircle the body of the bell.  The entire bronze bell uses high relief sculpture and two dragons support a ball of fire which symbolizes that Hong Kong is the motherland's 'Pearl of the Orient.'  Finally, the flower of Nanjing city, plum blossom, is the figure on the bell's strikeplate."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The first member of the Democracy Party that year to propose making the alarm bell, Yu Xiaodong, said emotionally, "Before I realized it, it is already ten years since Hong Kong's return."  He hopes that Hong Kong's tomorrow can be like the sound of the bell, "bright and long, and stretching forever without end."</seg>

<seg id="1"> Three Main Functions of Modern Military Uniforms</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> One, identification function.</seg>
<seg id="3"> To distinguish the important insignia of different nations' armies, different types of soldiers, armies and civilians.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Among the armies of over 100 large and small nations in the world, although the basic use of a military uniform is the same, the military uniforms of no two countries' armies are completely the same.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Two, symbolic function.</seg>
<seg id="6"> To a certain degree, a military uniform is the image of a nation's spirit, a reflection of its national characteristics, and is a focused embodiment of a nation's military capability and its soldiers' accomplishments.</seg>
<seg id="7"> In the three main categories of military uniform: ceremonial uniform, service uniform and training uniform, nothing is more capable of fully displaying national and military prestige than a stiff and tight-fitted, handsome-looking ceremonial uniform.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Three, protective function.</seg>
<seg id="9"> With the rapid development of new high-technology weapons, improving the overall protective performance of new types of training uniform and making military uniform bullet proof, detection proof, chemical proof, germ proof, radiation proof, as well as having temperature control, moisture control, gas control and various other functions, has become the foremost issue in military uniform development.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Certain Battalion Party Committee Dares to Stick to its Guns to Handle Thorny Problem</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Staff Report, Chengdu, July 3</seg>
<seg id="3"> Report by Qu Yimao and Yang Ruiyu: "We are able to live in an apartment thanks to the resolve and determination of the Battalion Party Committee to clear out the rooms."</seg>
<seg id="4"> Today, more than ten cadres from a communication training battalion in Chengdu Military Command all look very happy as they move to an apartment block .  They are full of admiration and appreciation at the style in which "the team" of the Battalion Party Committee dared to stick to their guns and struggle against obstacles to resolve a thorny problem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> In the last few years, as personnel have been replaced, a portion of this battalion's apartments in this family dormitory building was over-occupied, contrary to regulations, which made it difficult for cadres in service to find accommodation.  Officers and men have expressed considerable objections concerning this matter.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The battalion also cleared out the apartments several times before, but due to resistance they settled the matter by leaving it unsettled, which turned this issue into a long-standing problem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> "If only one sticks to one's guns and is fair and reasonable, there are no unsolvable problems."</seg>
<seg id="8"> After the new party committee team achieved consensus, major leaders came out in person to set about completely clearing up all the problems where apartments were occupied contrary to regulations.</seg>
<seg id="9"> On the one hand, they appealed to people's emotion and explained through reason, hoping that the people concerned would consider the overall situation; on the other hand they explained clearly the related policies and regulations on military apartments, pooled housing and economic housing, and made clear the party committee's determination, resolve and standpoint on principles.</seg>
<seg id="10"> For some people with housing elsewhere yet unwilling to withdraw from over-occupied housing, the party committee promptly contacted their work unit and took corresponding steps to urge them to actively cooperate with the army's work.</seg>
<seg id="11"> After two months of painstaking work, all the residents of buildings on the campgrounds that were over-occupied against regulations moved out on schedule and the serving battalion cadres were allotted housing according to regulations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> This style in which the Battalion Party Committee dares to stick to its guns and struggle against obstacles also created a domino effect: a few cadres originally unwilling to actively cooperate with the organization's allocation, now also, one by one, expressed submission to the organization's decision.</seg>

<seg id="4"> This morning, a meeting celebrating the award of Second Class Collective Merit by the Public Security Ministry to the Hospital of Guangdong Frontier Defense Army and reporting the exemplary deeds of supporting the government and cherishing the people  was solemnly held in Shenzhen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The self-sworn duty of the Hospital of the Guangdong Frontier Defense Army is to build a harmonious society and it has successively established three fair-priced hospitals in Shenzhen's Buji, Longhua and Bao'an specifically targeted towards migrant workers.  The registration fee for a doctor's visit for migrant workers is only one yuan, and examination fees and surgical fees are all at 20% off.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 28 (Correspondent Cui Junqiang) When next year's Olympics are held, Beijing in August, with its high temperature and humidity, is expected to transform into a sea of fresh flowers.</seg>
<seg id="3"> By employing technology to change the flower season, and other measures, scientific researchers have found a good strategy to add color to the Olympic Games.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> At the "Summer Olympics Optimal New Flower Variety Selection and Cultivation Applications Research" project acceptance meeting held on the 28th in Beijing, assessment experts arrived at the conclusion that the use of new technology to spur and control flower cultivation will enable different flower types or varieties with different natural flower seasons to bloom in the same time in the summer, thus the best visual effect will be achieved in August when the Beijing Olympic Games will be held .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> In the Beijing summer, often only a dozen or so types of blooming flowers can be seen.  The majority of flowers have either already withered or are still a long time away from their buds opening.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Through their endeavors, scientific researchers chose 206 types and over 400 varieties of the most optimal flowers for the Summer Olympics.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> At the "2007 Olympics Flower Exhibition" to be held in Haidian Park, Beijing, around the one year countdown to the Beijing Olympic Games opening, a batch of fresh and bright-colored flowers carefully cultivated by scientific researchers, that in the past have been unable to naturally bloom in August, will welcome visitors.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> On July 1, the Warning Bell at Jinghai Temple Memorial in Nanjing was struck again, giving melodious bell strokes.</seg>
<seg id="3"> The sophisticated echo of history "connected" the mainland and Hong Kong through a TV channel, so that Nanjing citizens and Hong Kong compatriots "shared the moments across the land" to celebrate together the 10th anniversary of Hong Kong's return to the motherland.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> At 12:00am July 1 ten years ago, the bell tower at Jinghai Temple Memorial in Nanjing was reverberated with 155 strokes of the Warning Bell, which bid farewell to the humiliating history of ceding the Hong Kong Island.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> People from various social circles of Nanjing gathered outside the modest-sized memorial entrance. They said they would strike the Warning Bell with their own hands, to warn themselves and offspring not to forget the history.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> "The Warning Bell is 1.842 meters tall, and 1842 is just the year in which the Nanjing Treaty was signed during the Opium War.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The bell shoulder is 1.997 meters tall, and 1997 is the year in which Hong Kong returned."</seg>
<seg id="8"> Wang Fengling, past planner and creator of the Warning Bell explained, "five strings of 'swastikas' surround the bell body. The entire copper bell is in high relief, with two dragons holding up a fire ball, which symbolizes Hong Kong as the "oriental pearl" of the motherland. Last, Nanjing's city flower, the plum flower, is used as the striking pattern on the bell body."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Yu Xiaodong, who is a democratic party member and the first to propose the creation of the Warning Bell back in those years, exclaimed, "without us knowing it, it has been ten years since Hong Kong's return." He hoped Hong Kong's future could be "bright, melodious and endless" just like the bell stokes.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Three Major Functions of Modern Military Uniforms</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> First is the identifying function,</seg>
<seg id="3"> an important symbol to distinguish among armies of different nations, among different armed services, and between troops and civilians.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Although the purposes of military uniforms are basically the same in the armed forces of some 100 nations big or small around the world, no armed forces of any two nations have identical military uniforms.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Second is the symbolizing function.</seg>
<seg id="6"> To some extent, military uniforms not only reflect a country's vitality and national characteristics, but also centrally showcases the combating capabilities and servicemen qualities of a country's armed forces.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Of the three major categories of military uniforms, dress uniforms, service uniforms and combat &amp; training uniforms, nothing is more able to fully demonstrate the might of a country and its military than the neat and elegant dress uniforms.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Third is the protective function.</seg>
<seg id="9"> With the rapid development of new and high-tech weapons, it has become a paramount issue in the development of military uniforms to improve the comprehensive protective performance of new combat &amp; training uniforms, so that military uniforms have various functions, such as protecting from bullets, reconnaissance, chemistry, bacteria and radiation, as well as conditioning the temperature, humidity and air.</seg>

<seg id="1"> The Party Committee Office of a Battalion Dare to Get Serious in Handling Thorny Problems</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> CHENGDU, July 3, by the newspaper</seg>
<seg id="3"> By Qu Yimao and Yang Ruiyu: "The fact that we can live in an apartment is attributed to the determination and resolution of the battalion's Party committee office to vacate houses."</seg>
<seg id="4"> Today, more than ten cadres of a communications training battalion at the Chengdu Military Region who moved into apartments were all lit up with pleasure, as they were filled with admiration and gratitude for the working style of the "team" at the battalion's Party committee that dare to get serious and meet challenges when tackling thorny problems.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> A few years earlier, with staff changing and being replaced, some homes in the battalion's family dormitory building were over-occupied in violation of rules, which brought housing difficulties to cadres on active service. Both officers and soldiers are quite unhappy over it.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The battalion had tried to vacate the homes several times, but left it unsettled because of various resistance, making this problem a hard nut to crack.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> "So long as we dare to get serious and are reasonable, there are no difficult problems that we can't solve."</seg>
<seg id="8"> Once the new Party committee reached the consensus, principal leaders went out personally to begin a thorough cleanup regarding the problem of irregular housing occupation.</seg>
<seg id="9"> They touched people sentimentally and enlightened them sensibly on the one hand, hoping that those involved could put the overall situation into perspective; on the other hand, they clarified applicable policies and rules of the troops about apartments, pool funded housing and economically affordable housing, expressing the resolute determination and fundamental stance of the Party committee.</seg>
<seg id="10"> For those people who had housing elsewhere, but were reluctant to return the over-occupied housing, the Party committee office made timely contact with their units and took necessary measures to urge them give cooperation to the troops' work on voluntary basis.</seg>
<seg id="11"> After two months of attentive efforts, all tenants in the barrack complex who over-occupied housing in violation of rules moved out on schedule, and the battalion's cadres on active service were all allocated housing in compliance with policies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The working style of the battalion's Party committee that dare to get serious and meet challenges also had chain effects, in that several cadres who were previously reluctant to give active cooperation in the organization's allocation have now said they would follow the organization's decisions.</seg>

<seg id="2"> BEIJING, July 28, Xinhua (Reporter Cui Junqiang) By the time the Olympics are held next year, the hot and humid Beijing in August is expected to become a sea of flowers.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Through such techniques as changing the florescence, researchers have found a good way to add colors to the Olympics.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> At the project review meeting for the "Selection and Applied Cultivation Studies of New Summer Olympic Flowers" in Beijing on the 28th, review experts concluded that using the new technology of forcing culture, flower breeds or varieties with different natural florescence can bloom concurrently in summer and reach the best state for viewing in August when Beijing Olympics are held.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> In Beijing's summer, only a dozen flowers are commonly seen in full blossom. Most flowers are either withered early on or far from being in bud.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Through efforts, researchers selected over 400 varieties of flowers in 206 breeds for the summer Olympics.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> At the "2007 Olympic Flowers Exhibition" at Haidian Park in Beijing, a group of flowers carefully bred by researchers that could not bloom naturally in August in the past will greet visitors with bright-colored blossoms around the one-year countdown to the opening of the Beijing Olympics.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> This newspaper, Chengdu, July 3</seg>
<seg id="3"> Reported by Qu Yimao, Yang Ruiyu: "We must thank the brigade's Party committee for its determination and courage in the eviction so that we can live in an apartment."</seg>
<seg id="4"> Today, more than 10 cadres of a communication training brigade in Chengdu Military Area Command who moved into apartments were all beaming with joy. They were full of respect and gratitude for the earnest and courageous way "the group" at the brigade Party Committee handled difficult issues.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> A few years ago, with personnel changes, some of the apartments in the residential building of the brigade were illegally occupied which caused a shortage in accommodation for cadres in active service. The officers and soldiers had quite a few complaints about it.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The brigade had tried evictions a few times before but due to various obstructions, nothing was settled every time, thus turning this into a complicated and long-pending problem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> "As long as one is persistent and reasonable, all problems can be resolved."</seg>
<seg id="8"> After the new Party committee group reached a consensus, the key leadership started to thoroughly straighten out all problems of illegal occupation of apartments themselves.</seg>
<seg id="9"> On the one hand, they resorted to emotional appeal through reasoning and hoped that the people involved would consider the big picture. At the same time, they clearly explained relevant policy stipulations on apartments, houses built by collected funds, and utility apartments of the army, and declared the Party committee's determination, principles and position.</seg>
<seg id="10"> For people who had housing elsewhere but were unwilling to return the illegally occupied housing, the Party committee immediately contacted the units to which they belonged and adopted corresponding measures to urge them to voluntarily cooperate with the work of the brigade.</seg>
<seg id="11"> After two months of meticulous work, all residents in the barrack site who had illegally occupied the apartments moved away on time. All cadres in the brigade who were in active service were given housing according to the rule.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The persistent and courageous work style of the brigade Party committee also created a chain effect. The few cadres who were unwilling to positively cooperate with the assignment of the organization in the beginning all indicated that they will follow the decision of the organization now.</seg>
