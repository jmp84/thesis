<seg id="1"> Nearly 500 People Dead in Monsoon Floods in India</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> According to reports from officials and the media, the number of people who have died this year in India because of heavy monsoon rains has risen to 474.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The Press Trust of India quoted the government minister for relief and rehabilitation Kadam as revealing today that in the last week, the monsoon has started in all of India's states one after another, and that the financial losses and casualties have been serious in all areas.  Just in Maharashtra, the state which includes Mumbai, India's largest city, the number of people known to have died has now reached 358.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Reports say that Kadam made the above statement to media and journalists as he was making an inspection of Mumbai.</seg>
<seg id="5"> He said that Maharashtra, which is also India's biggest cotton-producing state, was entirely covered with a vast expanse of water, and there were cities and towns numbering 27 and about 2000 villages which had been hit by serious flooding.  More than 10000 affected people had been evacuated to safe shelters.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The whole of India, from south to north, started to progressively enter the monsoon season a week ago.  The residents of each state all greeted the heavy rains as relief at the end of a long drought, but didn't expect that the rain would come with unexpected violence, a real deluge.  Highways have become rivers; houses in low-lying areas have been surbmerged in the water; the transport system is nearly paralyzed.  To date, figures show that nearly 500 people have unfortunately lost their lives to the floods.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Wimbledon Tennis Tournament: Djokovic Forfeits, Nadal Through to Final</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Spanish clay court master Nadal today played Serbian wizard Djokovic in the men's singles semi-finals of the Wimbledon championships.  At the end of the match, Djokovic was unable to continue to play because he was injured, forfeited and withdrew from the match.  Nadal won and entered the final.  He will replay the titanic struggle for the championship at the French Open against the Swiss king of the tennis world, Federer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Djokovic called for medics to treat his back injury during the course of both his last-16 and quarter-final matches.  Today, when he had played to the third set, he again called for a medic to treat him because of a blister on his toe.  He later felt that he could not play on with the injury and decided to forfeit the game.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Fourth seed Djokovic's withdrawal from the game allowed second seed Nadal, who was leading 3-6, 6-1, 4-1, to claim the victory and progress through.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Apart from losing the first set after being broken once due to a slow start at the beginning of the match, Nadal was in a leading position throughout the second and third sets.</seg>

<seg id="2"> UN International Atomic Energy Agency deputy director-general Heinonen today held talks with Iranian officials in Tehran, once again trying to break the deadlock created by Iran's nuclear plans.</seg>
<seg id="3"> But Iranian President Ahmadinejad remained defiant under increasing pressure from the UN's further sanctions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Ahmadinejad asserted that Iran will not stop uranium enrichment, but welcomed these new talks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> He said: "Progress towards the installation of centrifuges can be delayed or speeded up.  This is an administrative issue.  But no-one should expect us to give up our rights.  We will not stop this progress."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> He made this remark after Heinonen arrived in Tehran.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Heinonen's aim on this trip is to establish a plan to resolve "the outstanding issues" caused by Iran's nuclear plans.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The UN has already imposed two sets of sanctions on Iran because Tehran failed to freeze its uranium enrichment operation.</seg>
</p>

<seg id="11"> Wu Xiqin said that Wang Yan's current exercises mainly focused on "sitting."  "She can maintain a seated posture on a bench for a while, but still not for too long."  (Correspondent Wang Chunqiu)</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> A lawyer for Berezovsky, the Russian oligarch in exile in London, Borovkov, announced on July 2 that the Russian Federal Security Service had formally issued a new charge against his client, accusing Berezovsky of "plotting to engineer a coup d'état and attempting a violent seizure of political power in Russia."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Borovkov pointed out that in April this year Berezovsky had announced during an interview with a journalist from the British "Guardian" newspaper that he was preparing to launch a "palace coup" in Russia, and confirmed that he was providing financial support to representatives of the right-wing elite opposed to the policies of the administration.</seg>
<seg id="4"> The Russian Federal Security Service's investigation bureau immediately launched a criminal investigation against Berezovsky under article 278 on "forcible seizure of power" of the Penal Code of the Russian Federation, and has formally brought forward related charges in Moscow's Savyolovsky court recently.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> It is reported that the Russian Procuratorate-General brought criminal charges against Berezovsky in February 2006, similarly based on the exiled oligarch's confirmation during an interview that he was attempting a seizure of state power by force in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="6"> As Berezovsky has remained in exile abroad, making it impossible to extradite him, Russia authorities temporarily suspended the investigation of the case in January 2007.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> On July 2, Moscow's Savyolovsky court began to hear another criminal case against the exiled oligarch.  The Russian Procuratorate-General accused Berezovsky of embezzling funds of 214000000 roubles from Aeroflot and laundering 16000000 roubles.  After the hearing the court decided to postpone judicial investigation into this case till July 12, and a state defense lawyer will be assigned for the defendant in this period.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Berezovsky believes that this is all a "farce," and has explicitly prohibited his defense lawyer from taking part in the court hearings.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> According to a report in the US media on the 15th, there has recently been a trend in the US towards a sharp increase in the number of reports of heart diseases and other adverse reactions caused by Avandia, an anti-diabetic medicine.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> In May this year the US Food and Drug Administration issued a safety warning, recommending that sufferers from diabetes exercise caution when using Avandia, because a scientist had published a research report in the edition of the New England Journal of Medicine that came out on May 21, saying that this best-selling drug could greatly increase the incidence of and death rate from heart disease among sufferers.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Consequently, the safety of Avandia has received close attention by doctors and patients.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Statistics show that in the approximately one month following the issuing of the safety warning, the US FDA had received 357 reports of adverse reactions caused by Avandia, of which 38 were reports of deaths.</seg>
<seg id="6"> And yet the FDA had received just 50 and 73 reports of adverse reactions in January and February this year respectively.</seg>
<seg id="7"> These adverse reactions ranged from being as trivial as getting blisters to as serious as sudden deaths from heart disease.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> However, the US FDA's pharmaceuticals experts believe that it would currently be premature to reach the conclusion that Avandia is not safe.</seg>
<seg id="9"> The FDA will hold a hearing into the safety of Avandia on July 30.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Avandia, which came on the market in 1999, is an insulin sensitizer, suitable for treating Type 2 diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="11"> Some 6000000 diabetes sufferers worldwide have taken or are taking Avandia.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Avandia's producer, the British company GlaxoSmithKline, continues to believe that Avandia is safe, and that for suffers "the benefits outweigh the drawbacks."</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> An official in the US Department of Defense said on the 23rd that due to the Iraq war and changes in the world situation, the US Department of Defense is reconsidering a plan drawn up in 2002 to cut the number of US troops in Europe by approximately half.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The US media cited a Department of Defense official as saying that due to the ongoing Iraq war and the worsening US relations with Russia and Iran, Department of Defense leaders have raised doubts about the feasibility of plans to cut troops in Europe.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> In 2002 the then Secretary of Defense Rumsfield announced that the US would reduce troop numbers in Europe from the original 113000 to 71000 before 2012, in order to create a new-style army with "fewer, but better" soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="5"> The US army's total forces in Europe have currently fallen to 100000 people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> But in June this year, Commander Craddock of the US Army Headquarters in Europe submitted a report to the current secretary of defense, Gates, raising doubts over the above-mentioned reduction plan.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The report said that while US army forces are being reduced in Europe, many military units would be deployed on a rotation basis to Iraq and Afghanistan for combat, leading to a shortfall in US troops in Europe to such an extent that there would be no way to develop normal cooperation with European allies.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The report recommended halting the plan to reduce US troops in Europe.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Relevant US experts believe that the above-mentioned phenomenon shows that the prolonged and unresolved Iraq war has disrupted the original US military's restructuring plans.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> In order to better implement the "Food Hygiene Law" and the State Council's "Resolution on Further Strengthening Food Safety Work," the Ministry of Health has launched a hygiene supervision status publicity system as a pilot project in the restaurant trade in ten areas, namely Haidian district in Beijing municipality, Tianjin municipality, Taizhou city and Jiangyan city in Jiangsu, Hangzhou city in Zhejiang province, Luoyang city in Henan province, Wuhan city in Hubei province, Haikou city and Sanya city in Hainan province, and Chengdu city in Sichuan province.</seg>
<seg id="3"> This system will also be gradually rolled out nationwide.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The restaurant trade hygiene supervision publicity system conducts on-the-spot supervision investigations on the basis of day-to-day hygiene supervision in 9 important areas of hygiene, namely restaurant trade work units' hygiene permits, their hygiene management systems, their hygiene management personnel, the health certificates of the personnel involved, food product quality and labeling, health protection in the food-processing process, environmental hygiene in processing areas, the cleaning and disinfection of kitchenware, and the acquisition of purchase documentation for the main raw materials used.

<seg id="1"> People's Armed Force Department in Jingjiang City Sets up a Platform to Raise the Quality of Their Full-time Cadres</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Staff Writer, Report by Cao Jiawei and Zhu Chunbin: On June 18, at a training class for People's Armed Force full-time cadres in Jingjiang city in Jiangsu province, Lu Yuqing, leader of the People's Armed force department of Xilai township, delivered a training lecture "Winning a Psychological War under Informationalized Conditions" that received a unanimous favorable assessment from the trainees.</seg>
<seg id="3"> This was a new change that was brought about by the city's People's Armed Force when it has put more pressure on its cadres based on the reality of their positions in an effort to raise People's Armed Force cadres' comprehensive quality.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> At the beginning of this year, the People's Armed force party committee discovered during investigation and research at the grassroots level that some of the People's Armed Force cadres had served for a long time, had too many concurrent duties, and had not put their chief energies into the armed force work.</seg>
<seg id="5"> For this reason, they have adopted methods including centralized training, replacing training with meetings, and relying on local party schools to conduct training, thus regularly training military cadres, in an effort to resolve problems such as the narrow knowledge base and the uniform focus of the professional quality of military cadres.</seg>
<seg id="6"> In combination with the central work, they boldly assign tasks to military cadres and put more pressure on them, and raise their performance by on-the-job training.</seg>
<seg id="7"> At the same time, they have actively coordinated with local organizational departments and jointly drafted the "People's Armed Forces Cadres' Competition for Jobs Scheme," and explicitly stipulated that the leaders of People's Armed Forces departments must join the party committee of the same level and cannot concurrently take on other jobs.</seg>
<seg id="8"> They have set up a military cadres' restructuring exchange mechanism to promptly regulate exchanges on some older military cadres who are not suitable for grassroots People's Armed forces work, and promote and use some comrades of good comprehensive quality and strong work ability.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Not long ago, a domestic gap was filled by the underwater boat-welding technology invented and developed by the People's Militia technology platoon under the leadership of the secretary of the armed department of the New Century Shipbuilding Company Limited, Chen Yisong, who was exceptionally promoted as the company's armed department leader.</seg>

<seg id="3"> Today, this correspondent saw from the launch ceremony of the Armed Police 07-series uniform and the dressing demonstration event that the current uniform change altogether includes 105 types of clothing in four main categories, namely ceremonial attire, everyday uniform, drill uniform, and symbols and accessories.</seg>
<seg id="4"> The color of the uniform is being adjusted from the current olive green to deep olive green.  Ornamental trim is being sewn on all sleeve cuffs and pant side hems.  The overall design feels very modern, and national clothing specification standards have been consulted while drawing up specifications.</seg>

<seg id="6"> The newly added name tags, rank and qualifications badges, national defense military service badges and ribbons, as well as redesigned cap insignia, chest symbols, tie toggles, epaulets and sleeve insignia have strengthened the identification function of the clothing and improved its esthetic appearance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The Armed Police will be issued with their 07-series uniform over 3 years.</seg>
<seg id="8"> By August 1, 2007, police officers, civilian cadres and the National Flag Guard, military orchestras, and song-and-dance troupes will be issued with their ceremonial attire in keeping with the entire military.

<seg id="1"> "Small, Scattered, Far and Direct" Education Coordination Zones Go into Operation in a Second Artillery Unit Base</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Staff Writer, Report by Xue Bingjian and Correspondent Xu Yeqing: The situation in the "small, scattered, far and direct" units where education organization is difficult, resources are meager, and each fends for itself, will become history at a second artillery unit base.</seg>
<seg id="3"> This correspondent learned recently that following a half-year pilot project, this base has handed down "The Method of Fully Implementing 'An Outline for Ideological and Political Education'."  A number of ideological and political education coordination zones covering all the "small, scattered, far and direct" units in the base have officially been brought into operation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> In order to push ahead with the effective implementation of "An Outline for Ideological and Political Education," the base organized resources at the beginning of the year to conduct in-depth investigation and research of the ideological and political education situation in "small, scattered, far and direct" units.  They combed through important issues that influence and restrict the education time, personnel and results, and initially established this new-style education model of coordination zones for the "small, scattered, far and direct" units.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The concrete approach of coordination zones is to break down the organizational boundaries among units and set up a brigade and regiment-level unit to take the lead in the areas where the "small, scattered, far and direct" units are relatively concentrated, and conduct an integrated program for thematic education, with units falling under different hierarchies coming together in nearby places for lectures or using the help of video link-up systems for remote discussions.</seg>
<seg id="6"> They have adopted a method that integrates taking turns in giving lessons and competing for posts, and unifying the allocation of educational resources.  In each area the use of educational hardware will be integrated, and each unit's materials, data and educational experiences will be shared and exchanged with those of others, with regular organization in each area of typical tour reports and exchanges of what they got from the study by the officers and men.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Every coordination zone has set up a devoted educational liaison person and a part-time educational information gatherer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> On this basis, each coordination zone has also set up systems for seeking assistance on difficult issues, holding joint discussions on major educational themes, reporting critical ideological situations, and assessing tests and evaluations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Zhang Shengmin, the director of the base's political department, told this correspondent that constructing political education coordination zones has both reduced the waste of educational resources and deepened the impact of education.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Some political instructors fear they will lose marks in front of officers and men from other units and have taken the initiative to study new things and seek new educational methods.</seg>
<seg id="11"> The officers and men receiving the education have also enthusiastically digested the educational content, out of concern over expressing themselves in layman's language in front of the officers and men of friendly neighboring units during discussion and analysis.</seg>
<seg id="12"> In this way, the enthusiasm of the people giving and receiving education has been both effectively stimulated.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> Staff Writer, Report by Zhang Junhong and Liu Hongjun: On July 17, led by vice-chief engineer Zhang Weiliang of a North China Sea fleet repair brigade, 31 of the brigade's long-serving frontline repair sailors happily stepped on a train to go to Beidaihe for a period of rest and recuperation.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Luo Xiangming, an NCO class, happily told this writer, "That the brigade's leaders care about and cherish the sailors deeply moves us.  After a period of rest and recuperation, we will definitely work doubly hard!"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> This is actually the first time that this brigade has organized rest and recuperation for grassroots sailors.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Not long ago, the brigade commander Yao Qingsheng went down to the grassroots units and saw that sailors responsible for repair work were braving high temperatures to carry out equipment maintenance and repair work, deeply moving Yao Qingsheng.</seg>
<seg id="6"> "As the sailors work selflessly, the party committee should care about and cherish the sailors, and take responsibility for the sailors' health."  At a meeting of the party committee, Yao Qingsheng's words were endorsed by everyone.</seg>
<seg id="7"> After looking into the matter, the party committee reached a decision to give the entire R&amp;R quota allocated to the brigade by senior authorities to the sailors doing repair work on the frontline.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Staff Writer</seg>
<seg id="3"> Report by Wang Weiqin and Specially Contracted Correspondent Li Deying: On July 25, this writer observed in a service support company of the Ji'nan Military Command that invitations for an army engineering tender, details of financial expenditure, promotions of cadres, non-commissioned officers being admitted to the Party and other major matters were written up on a bulletin board, and hung up conspicuously in a display cabinet.</seg>
<seg id="4"> As Political Commissar Su Chengsen explained, this is a concrete measure adopted by the section to promote a system where things are done openly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> At the beginning of this year, the unit party committee drew up measures including "Two-way Supervision Between the Organization and the Grassroots" and "Publicizing Sensitive Issues" to strengthen the construction of the party spirit and honest government, requiring that for all significant issues that involve the direct interests of the officers and men and army development, the opinions of grassroots officers and men are first heard before decisions are reached, and that standards, procedures, and results etc of the handling of the matters are made public from start to finish in line with the circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The unit has installed a suggestion box and a bulletin board, and has opened a "message board" on its Intranet to collect everyone's views and recommendations in an extensive way.</seg>
<seg id="7"> At the beginning of the year, as the renovation project of the soldiers' barracks was about to start, before the work began, the party committee organ extensively solicited the views of the officers and men, and then released the information on inviting bids, implementing a system of open tenders.</seg>
<seg id="8"> This both saved money and won the support of the officers and men.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Doing things in an open and fair way has driven the formation of a good atmosphere at the grassroots.</seg>
<seg id="10"> In this unit, the grassroots company insists on making regular public announcements and notices, no matter whether they are issues as big as the determination of "hot-button" sensitive matters, or as trivial as personal vacations to visit relatives or daily income and expenditure in the mess accounts, thus taking the initiative to receive the supervision of the masses.</seg>

<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan,  July 11 (Correspondents Liu Yang and Pi Shuchu)</seg>
<seg id="3"> When 13 pilots  handed in their resignations, their "boss," the China Eastern Airlines Wuhan Co. Ltd asked them for compensation for a huge sum of up to 105000000.  This is the largest sum claimed in damages so far in a labor dispute case in Hubei province.</seg>
<seg id="4"> The Labor Dispute Arbitration Commission of Hubei province is currently trying this case.</seg>
<seg id="5"> In May this year, 13 pilots with China Eastern Airlines Wuhan Company in succession handed in their resignations, which were rejected by the company.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Soon afterwards, the pilots applied one after another at the beginning of June to the Labor Dispute Arbitration Commission of Hubei province for labor arbitration, requesting for a ruling that their labor relationship with China Eastern Airlines Wuhan Company be terminated.</seg>
<seg id="7"> After China Eastern Airlines Wuhan Company received notice of the suit, it advanced a counterclaim and requested that the 13 pilots pay for losses caused by their breaking their labor contract agreements and canceling their labor contracts, ranging from more than 6000000 yuan to 10000000 yuan respectively, totaling 105000000 yuan.</seg>
<seg id="8"> It has been learned that the labor contract the pilots signed with China Eastern Airlines was of unfixed duration.  Unless the conditions agreed in the labor contract for breaking off or canceling the agreement applied, the labor contract was to remain in force until the pilots' legal retirement age.</seg>
<seg id="9"> The Labor Dispute Arbitration Commission of Hubei province will try and deal with this case as a suit and a countersuit together, and it is hoped that the hearing will be over by August 8.</seg>

<seg id="4"> According to a report by the Korean Central News Agency, North Korea's military representative and senior colonel in the Korean People's Army, Pak Rim Su, brought forward a proposal during that day's contact to set up a joint fishing zone in North Korea's West Sea between Yonphyong island to Paekryong island, and gave a detailed explanation of the rationale for it.</seg>
<seg id="5"> He said that in order to set up a joint fishing zone, it is necessary to implement the principles such as those of seeking maximum common national prosperity and benefits and of safeguarding peaceful and secure fishing operations.</seg>
<seg id="6"> While talking about the issue of the bilaterally disputed maritime border, Pak Rim Su said that in order to prevent military conflict between the two sides in the West Sea, the two sides should renounce the maritime borders they have hitherto insisted on, recognize and respect each other's rights to territorial seas, and accept as the basis for negotiations the relevant agreements between North Korea and South Korea, the Korean armistice agreement, and internationally recognized law.</seg>
<seg id="7"> He said that the "persistent standpoint" of the North Korean military was to promptly draw up military safeguard measures in order to promote cooperative exchanges between North and South Korea.</seg>
<seg id="8"> He said that the South Korean side should adopt military measures right now to ensure that North Korean civilian vessels can sail directly south from Haeju port and freely pass through the Jeju Straits.</seg>
<seg id="9"> This has been the second round of military talks and routine contacts held recently between both North and South Korea since the 10th of this month.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Russian Security Service Charges Exiled Oligarch with "Coup Plot"</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Borovkov, lawyer of the Russian oligarch Berezovsky exiled in London, said on July 2 that the Russian FSB has formally filed a new charge against his client, accusing Berezovsky of "conspiring to plot a coup against the state and attempting to seize Russian political power by violence."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> In an interview with a reporter of Britain's The Guardian in April this year, Berezovsky declared he was preparing to mount a "palace coup" in Russia, confirming he was providing financial assistance to representatives of the right-wing elites who were against the government policy, Borovkov noted.</seg>
<seg id="4"> The Russian FSB's Investigation Bureau immediately began criminal investigation in Berezovsky in compliance with article 278, Violent Seizure of Power, of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation and formally filed applicable charges to the Savelovsky Court in Moscow in recent days.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> It is learned that in February 2006, the Office of the Russian Persecutor General had filed criminal charges against Berezovsky, on the same ground that the exiled oligarch confirmed his attempt to obtain Russian political power by force.</seg>
<seg id="6"> As Berezovsky had been in exile abroad and could not be extradited, Russia halted probing of the case temporarily in January 2007.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The Savelovsky Court initiated another criminal case against the exiled oligarch, in which the Office of the Russian Persecutor General accused Berezovsky of embezzling funds of 214000000 rubles from a Russian airway and laundering 16000000 rubles. After hearings, the court has decided to postpone court probing until July 12 and will appoint a state defense attorney for the defendant during this time.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Berezovsky thought all these were "a farce" and clearly forbade his defense attorneys to participate in court trials.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> According to a US media report on the 15th, there has recently been a tendency of significant increase in the number of adverse reaction reports, such as cardiac diseases, caused by the anti-diabetes drug Avandia in the United States.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The US Food and Drug Administration issued a safety warning in May this year, advising diabetes patients to take Avandia with caution, because scientists issued a study report in an edition of the New England Journal of Medicine published on May 21, saying the best-selling drug would significantly increase the rates of heart attack and death in patients.</seg>
<seg id="4"> The safety of Avandia has thus been closely watched by doctors and patients.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> According to statistics, within roughly a month after the safety warning, the US FDA received 357 reports of adverse reactions caused by Avandia, 38 of which are death reports.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Yet the FDA only received 50 and 73 reports of adverse reactions respectively in January and February this year.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The adverse reactions were as minor as blisters and as serious as sudden death due to heart attack.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> However, drug experts at the US FDA believe it is yet too early to conclude that Avandia is unsafe.</seg>
<seg id="9"> The FDA is going to hold a hearing regarding the safety of Avandia on July 30.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Avandia, introduced in 1999, is an insulin sensitizer for treating type II diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="11"> Some 6000000 diabetes patients around the world has taken or is taking Avandia.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> A US Defense Department official said on the 23rd that the US Pentagon is reconsidering a 2002 plan to cut US troops stationed in Europe by about half because of the war in Iraq and changes in the world situation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> With the ongoing Iraq War and worsened US relations with Russia and Iran, the Pentagon leadership has questioned the feasibility of the plan to slash troops stationed in Europe, the US media said, quoting a Defense Department official.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> In 2002, the then Defense Secretary Rumsfeld announced the US would reduce troops in Europe from 113000 to 71000 by 2012, in order to create a "lean and effective" new force.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Total US troops stationed in Europe have decreased to 100000 so far.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> However, Craddock, Commander of the US European Command, submitted a report to current Defense Secretary Gates in June this year, in which he questioned the aforesaid reduction plan.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The report says the slash of US troops stationed in Europe is accompanied by rotational transfer of many forces to Iraq and Afghanistan for battles, which leads to a shortage of US military personnel stationed in Europe, such that they are unable to conduct regular cooperation with European allies.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The report recommends halting the plan to cut US troops in Europe.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Experts in the US believe the phenomenon above indicates that the Iraq War has been such a long drag that it has disrupted the original adjustment plan of the US military.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> By Cao Jiawei and Zhu Chunbin, PLA Daily: On June 18, at an intensive training program for armed force cadres in the city of Jingjiang, Jiangsu Province, the lecture Win the Psychological Warfare in the Context of Informationization by Lu Yuqing, Director of the Xilai Town Department of People's Armed Force, received positive comments amongst all participants.</seg>
<seg id="3"> This was a fresh change as a result of the city's Department of People's Armed Force loading burdens onto armed force cadres and working to boost the overall quality of armed force cadres in line with the reality of different posts.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> At the beginning of this year, when doing grassroot research, the Party committee of the Department of People's Armed Force found that some armed force cadres did not focus on doing work related to the armed forces due to long years of service and multiple duties.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Therefore, they have conducted training regularly for armed force cadres using such methods such as intensive training, meeting as a way of training, relying on local Party school to provide training, with a view to address problems such as narrow knowledge spectrum and lack of versatile work skills.</seg>
<seg id="6"> In line with the core responsibilities, it has assigned tasks and loaded burdens onto armed force cadres boldly to improve their competency through on-the-job practice.</seg>
<seg id="7"> In addition, by actively coordinating with local organization departments, they jointly formulated the Scheme of Position Competitions Amongst Armed Force Cadres, which explicitly requires head of an armed force department to be on the Party committee of the same level without concurrently assuming other jobs;</seg>
<seg id="8"> and set up an adjustment and exchange mechanism for armed force cadres, whereby some armed force cadres who are older or not suitable for grassroot armed force positions are adjusted or exchanged in a timely fashion, while comrades with good overall quality and high competency are promoted.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Recently, Chen Yisong, a clerk of the armed force department at the New Century Shipbuilding Co., Ltd., who led a militia technical unit to fill a void of the nation with their innovatively developed underwater ship welding technique, was promoted to the company's head of armed force department as an exception to the rule.</seg>

<seg id="1"> "SDRD" education collaboration areas Launched in SAF Base</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> By Xue Bingjian and Reporter Xu Yeqing, PLA Daily: The phenomenon where education at small, dispersed, remote and direct (SDRD) units is hard to organize, lacking in resources and individually carried out will be history in a base of the Second Artillery Force.</seg>
<seg id="3"> The reporters learned recently that after a six-month pilot project, the base handed down Steps to Implement "Ideological and Political Education Outline" and several ideological and political education collaboration areas that cover all its SDRD units have officially begun operation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> To promote effective implementation of the Ideological and Political Education Outline, the base organized efforts to perform in-depth investigation and research into the status of ideological and political education at SDRD units early this year and sorted out key problems that affected and constrained the time, people and effects of the education, creating the new education pattern of collaboration areas for SDRD units.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The specific practice of the collaboration areas is to break the bound of units and in an area where the SDRD units are relatively concentrated, designate a brigade or regiment level unit as the coordinator, which will conduct centralized planning of theme education. Units of different relationships of subordination and affiliation attend lectures together at a close location or hold remote discussions with video systems.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Education capabilities are centrally allocated by way of rotational lectures in conjunction with position competitions; education hardware within a area is used in a coordinated manner, information and data, as well as experience in education of each unit are shared and exchanged, report tours about typical examples in an area are organized regularly, and officers and soldiers discuss what they have learned from study.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Each collaboration area has put in place a full-time education contact and a part-time education information collector.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Building on this, the collaboration areas also established systems of seeking help with hard problems, joint consultations on major educational topics, emergency briefing of ideological situations, and that of assessment and evaluation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Zhang Shengmin, director of the base's Political Department, told the reporters that establishing the political education collaboration areas has not only minimized waste of educational resources, but also deepened the effects of education.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Some political instructors voluntarily learn new knowledge and seek new methods of education for fear of losing marks in front of officers and soldiers from other units.</seg>
<seg id="11"> Officers and soldiers receiving education also digest what is taught, for fear of saying anything unprofessional in front of officers and soldiers from friendly and neighboring units during discussion and analysis.</seg>
<seg id="12"> As such, passions of the educators and the educated are both effectively inspired.</seg>

<seg id="1"> "Hotspots" Not Hot Due to Transparent Business Procedures at a Force in Jinan Military Region</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> PLA Daily</seg>
<seg id="3"> By Wang Weiqin and special correspondent Li Deying: The authors saw on July 25 at the Service Company of a force at the Jinan Military Region that a bulletin board with such important issues as the force's invitations to tender for projects, financial spending, cadre promotions, and non commissioned officers joining the Party, was hung conspicuously in the display window.</seg>
<seg id="4"> According to the Commissar Su Chengsen, this was a concrete step of the force to promote the policy of transparent business procedures.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Early this year, with a view to enhance the construction of an ethical Party culture and an integral governing body, the Party committee of the force developed measures such as Reciprocal Supervision between Authorities and Grassroots and Public Notification of Sensitive Issues and requested that opinions of grassroot officers and soldiers be heard before decisions are made on every major issue related to the vital interests of officers and soldiers and the construction of the military force and that business handling criteria, procedures and results be made transparent as necessary throughout the process.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The military force set up an opinion box, a bulletin board, and a "message board" on the Local Area Network to collect people's comments and suggestions extensively.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Early the year, renovation work of the soldiers' dormitory building got started. Before work began, the Party committee office solicited opinions of officers and soldiers extensively and then issued tender information to invite tenders openly,</seg>
<seg id="8"> not only saving funds, but also winning the support of officers and soldiers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Transparent and fair business procedures have brought about a healthy culture at grassroots.</seg>
<seg id="10"> In this military force, grassroot companies have consistently issued notifications and announcements on a regular basis and voluntarily accepted people's monitoring on such major issues as the decision of a hot and sensitive matter to such petty issues as family visits and vacations of individuals or daily expenses of food accounts.</seg>

<seg id="3"> Glacier experts at the Swiss Academy of Sciences found in a longitudinal study that the more than 1800 glaciers in Switzerland are declining at an average annual rate of 3 percent between 1850 to 2005.</seg>
<seg id="4"> The heat wave in 2003 alone had caused 1.8 percent of Alpine glaciers to melt.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Experts believed that if global temperature rose by 3 degree Celsius by 2100, the glaciers would be 80 percent less than today. If global temperature rose by 5 degree Celsius, then the glaciers would be completely melted.</seg>

<seg id="6"> The Aletsch Glacier is the longest glacier in Europe. It has been inscribed by UNESCO into the World Heritage List. However, it had reduced by 100 meters in just one year between 2005 and 2006. The protection of natural environment has reached a point that demands immediate attention.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Russian Security Service Charges Exiled Magnate Berezovsky with "Conspiring Coup"</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Borovkov, attorney of Russian magnate Berezovsky who is in exile in London, announced on July 2 that the Russian Federal Security Service has formally indicted his client with a new charge by accusing Berezovsky of "conspiring to stage a coup with an attempt to seize political power in Russia by force".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Borovkov said that during an interview with a reporter of the Guardian  in Britain this April, Berezovsky announced that he was preparing to mount a "palace coup" in Russia and confirmed that he was providing financial support to representatives of the Rightist elites who opposed to the policies of the authorities.</seg>
<seg id="4"> The Investigation Directorate of the Russian Federal Security Service immediately initiated a criminal case against Berezovsky under Article 278  "forcible seizure of power" of the Penal Code of the Russian Federation and formally filed a corresponding charge with Moscow's Savelovsky Court recently.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Allegedly, the Russian Office of the Prosecutor-General had filed a criminal charge against Berezovsky in February 2006 with the same evidence that the exiled tycoon confirmed in an interview his attempt to seize political power in Russia by force.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Since Berezovsky had been in exile ever since and could not be extradited, Russia temporarily terminated the investigation of the case in January 2007.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> On July 2, Moscow's Savelovsky Court began the hearing of another criminal case against the exiled magnate. The Russian Office of the Prosecutor-General charged Berezovsky with embezzling Russian airline Aeroflot of £ 214000000 in capital and laundering £ 16000000. After hearing the evidence, the court decided to postpone the court investigation to July 12. It will assign a state-appointed defense attorney for the defendant here.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Berezovsky argued that these are all "farces" and clearly prohibited his defense attorney to take part in the court hearings.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> According to reports of U.S. media on the 15th, the number of reports on adverse reactions caused by diabetes drug Avandia such as heart attack has significantly increased in the United States in recent days.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a safety warning this May suggesting diabetics to take precaution in taking Avandia because scientists published a study report in the May 21 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine stating that this best-selling drug will greatly increase patients' risk of heart attack and death rate.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Doctors and patients thus paid close attention to the safety of Avandia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Statistics showed that within approximately a month after the safety warning was issued, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration received 357 reports on adverse reactions caused by Avandia, 38 of which were reports of death.</seg>
<seg id="6"> While in January and February this year, the Food and Drug Administration only received 50 and 73 cases of adverse reaction reports respectively.</seg>
<seg id="7"> These adverse reactions range from minor one of having blisters to serious one of sudden death from heart attack.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> However, drug experts at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration believed that it is now still too early to draw a conclusion that Avandia is unsafe.</seg>
<seg id="9"> The Food and Drug Administration will hold a hearing on the safety of Avandia on July 30.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Avandia, an insulin sensitizer, was introduced in 1999. It is suitable for treating type II diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="11"> There are approximately 6000000 diabetics worldwide who have taken or are currently taking Avandia.</seg>
<seg id="12"> GlaxoSmithKline, the British manufacturer of Avandia, has always considered Avandia safe and 'has more benefits than harm' for the patients.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> An official of the U.S. Department of Defense said on the 23rd that due to the War on Iraq and changes in global situation, the U.S. Department of Defense is reconsidering its plan to cut approximately half of the U.S. troops in Europe formulated in 2002.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> U.S. media quoted a Department of Defense official as saying that since the War on Iraq is still going on and the US-Russia and US-Iran relationships are deteriorating, the leadership at the Department of Defense raised doubts about the feasibility of the plan to cut the troops in Europe.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> In 2002, the then Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld announced that the United States would reduce the original 113000 troops in Europe to 71000 by 2012 in order to build a new "small and elite" army.</seg>
<seg id="5"> The number of U.S. troops in Europe is currently reduced to 100000.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> However, Craddock, commander-in-chief of U.S. European Command, submitted a report to the current Secretary of Defense Gates in June questioning the above reduction plan.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The report said that while the U.S. troops in Europe are being reduced, many troops are be rotated into Iraq and Afghanistan to fight, thus causing a shortage in U.S. troops in Europe. As a result, they cannot cooperate normally with their European allies.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The report suggested a halt to the plan to cut U.S. troops in Europe.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="9"> Relevant experts in the United States argued that the above phenomenon shows that the prolonged War on Iraq has disrupted the original adjustment plan of the U.S. army.</seg>

<seg id="5"> To this end, they adopted measures including centralized training, coaching seminars, and reliance on training offered by local Party schools to provide regular training to cadres of the Department of People's Armed Forces and concentrated efforts on resolving issues including the narrow range of knowledge and one-dimensional professional qualifications of the cadres of the Department of People's Armed Forces.</seg>

<seg id="7"> At the same time, they actively coordinated with local organizations and departments and jointly formulated the Program for Cadres of the Department of People's Armed Forces to Compete for Job Positions that clearly stipulated that chiefs of the Department of Armed Forces must join the team of Party committee at the same level and not to hold other concurrent duties;</seg>
<seg id="8"> they established the adjustment and exchange mechanism for cadres of the Department of People's Armed Forces. For cadres of the Department of People's Armed Forces who are relatively old and cannot adapt to grassroots armed forces work, they made adjustments and exchanges immediately. For compatriots who had good comprehensive qualities and strong work abilities, they promoted and employed them.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Education Cooperation Zones in Small, Scattered, Remote, Independent Units Begin Operation at Second Artillery Base</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> This newspaper, reported by Xue Bingjian, Reporter Xu Yeqing: The phenomena of difficult organization, limited resources, and lack of coordination in education encountered by small, scattered, remote, and independent units will become history for a base of the Second Artillery.</seg>
<seg id="3"> The reporters recently learned that after half a year of pilot, the base promulgated the Enactment Measures to Implement Ideological and Political Education Syllabus that cover several ideological and political education cooperation zones in all small, scattered, remote, and independent units at the base. The measures are officially in operation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> In order to promote the effective implementation of the Ideological and Political Education Syllabus, the base allocated resources to conduct an in-depth survey on the ideological and political education situation in small, scattered, remote, and independent units in the beginning of the year. They sorted out key issues that affected and restricted the time, personnel, and effects of the education and initially formed the new educational model of cooperation zones for small, scattered, remote, and independent units.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The details of the cooperation zones are, break away from the restrictions of authorized force of the units, and designate a unit at the brigade or regiment level in a sub-area where small, scattered, remote, and independent units are relatively concentrated to take the lead to conduct standardized planning of thematic education. Units under different affiliations will attend classes together nearby or to hold long-distance discussions by means of video system.</seg>
<seg id="6"> They adopt the practice of integrating teaching rotation and competing for job positions to conduct consolidated allocation of education force. Education hardware in the sub-area is put under centralized use. Information and data of all units, as well as education experiences are shared and exchanged. Report tours by model sub-areas and sharing of educational experiences among officers and men are regularly organized.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Each cooperation unit has set up full-time education contacts and part-time education information gatherers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> On this foundation, all cooperation zones have also established systems for seeking help in difficult questions, discussions on major educational topics, notification of emergency ideological situations, and examination and assessment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Zhang Shengmin, chief of the Political Department at the base, told reporters that the establishment of political education cooperation zones both reduces waste in educational resources and deepens educational effects.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Some political instructors worry that they will lose points in front of officers and men from outside units, so they take the initiative to learn new knowledge and explore new educational methods.</seg>
<seg id="11"> Officers and men being taught also actively digest educational contents in fear that they will sound unprofessional in front of officers and men from neighboring units during discussion, differentiation, and analysis.</seg>
<seg id="12"> In this case, the enthusiasm of both the educators and the ones who receive the education is effectively stimulated.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> This newspaper</seg>
<seg id="3"> Reported by Wang Weiqin, Special Correspondent Li Deying: On July 25, the reporters saw at the combat support company of a unit under the Jinan Military Command that a notification board with important matters including calls for bids on projects of the unit, financial expenses, promotions of cadres, and admittance of warrant officers to the Party written on it was hung at an eye-catching spot in the display window.</seg>
<seg id="4"> According to Political Commissar Su Chengsen, this is a concrete measure that the unit adopts to advance the system of open work style.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Early this year, in order to strengthen the building of Party's style and of a clean government, the Party committee of this unit formulated measures including the Two-Way Supervision between State Organs and Grassroots and the Notification of the Public on Sensitive Matters. They requested decisions on major issues that involve personal interests of officers and soldiers and the building of the unit to be made after seeking opinions from grassroots soldiers as well as disclosure of the entire course of work including standards applied, procedures, and results based on the situation.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The unit has set up a suggestion box and notification board, as well as established a "message board" on the LAN to gather opinions and suggestions of the people on a large scale.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The soldiers' dormitory renovation project began at the beginning of the year. Before the project started, the Party committee solicited opinions from officers and soldiers extensively and then released bidding information and implemented open bidding.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The measure had saved fund and won the support of the officers and soldiers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Openness and fairness in work has promoted the formation of good morals at grassroots.</seg>
<seg id="10"> In this unit, whether they are major matters such as determination of central and sensitive issues or minor matters such as going home to visit relatives or taking vacation of an individual and daily expenses on food accounts, the grassroots companies still insist on notifying and announcing the matters regularly and subjecting to public monitoring conscientiously.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, July 11 (Reporters Liu Yang, Pi Shuchu)</seg>
<seg id="3"> China Eastern Airlines Wuhan Corp. Ltd., the "employer" of 13 pilots who resigned, claimed a huge compensation of 105000000 yuan against them. This labor dispute case involves the biggest claim ever in Hubei Province.</seg>
<seg id="4"> The Hubei Labor Dispute Arbitration Committee is currently hearing the case.</seg>
<seg id="5"> In May, 13 pilots working for the China Eastern Airlines Wuhan Corp. Ltd. resigned one after another. Their resignations were declined by the company.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Soon afterwards, in early June, the pilots submitted applications for labor arbitration with the Hubei Labor Arbitration Committee successively requesting a ruling to terminate the labor relations with the China Eastern Airlines Wuhan Corp. Ltd.</seg>
<seg id="7"> After the China Eastern Airlines Wuhan Corp. Ltd. received the Notice of Charge, it filed a counterclaim demanding the 13 pilots to pay the company for damages ranging from over 6000000 yuan to 10000000 yuan respectively incurred by the violation of agreements in the labor contracts and the termination of the labor contracts with a total of 105000000 yuan.</seg>
<seg id="8"> It was learned that the contracts the pilots signed with the China Eastern Airlines were ones without fixed time limit. Unless termination conditions or renunciation conditions agreed upon in the labor contracts appear, the labor contracts will be effective until the pilots reach legal retirement age.</seg>
<seg id="9"> The Hubei Labor Arbitration Committee will hear and handle the case together as an appeal and a counterclaim. The hearing is expected to end by August 8.</seg>

<seg id="3"> The Cuban team complained on the 21st that the boxing ring ropes at the Pan American Games were too short and would affect the performance of boxers.</seg>
<seg id="4"> According to the rules of the International Boxing Federation, the length of boxing ring ropes should be 6.1 meters long in international matches. However, based on the measurement of Pedro Roque, coach of the Cuban boxing team, the boxing ring ropes at the Pan American Games were more than 1 meter shorter than the standard.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Roque said, "We filed a formal protest because this does not just affect the country of Cuba but involves all the people.</seg>
<seg id="6"> If the ropes are too short, it will affect the sidestep movements of boxers."</seg>
<seg id="7"> He also said jokingly, "If they cannot find ropes that meet Olympics standards in Rio, they can find them somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="8"> We would have brought them from Cuba if we had known."</seg>
<seg id="9"> The Mexican and Colombian teams also expressed dissatisfaction with the length of the boxing ring ropes on the same day.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> US Treasury Secretary Paulson arrived yesterday on a visit to China.  The US is currently doing all it can to persuade China to carry out further necessary economic reforms and work on environmental protection.  The renminbi exchange rate is an issue that will receive particular attention.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> US diplomats say that Paulson first visited Xining, capital city of China's large northwestern province of Qinghai.</seg>
<seg id="4"> China is currently carrying out a series of plans for environmental protection near the largest freshwater lake in Qinghai Province.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Today Paulson will move on to Beijing to discuss pushing for progress in the US-China Strategic Economic Dialogue started last year and other issues with Chinese chief officials.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The US-China Strategic Economic Dialogue mainly discusses economic, environmental protection and other issues.  Yet, the most important is the issue of the renminbi exchange rate.  US congressmen believe that the renminbi is excessively undervalued.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The trade deficit between the US and China is quickly escalating.  Internal pressure within the US is gradually rising, and congressmen are ready to take retributive action to resist what they call China's unfair trade policies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Last week the US Senate Finance Committee overwhelmingly approved a bill requiring the Treasury to identify a list of countries with "fundamentally misaligned" currency exchange rates.  This opens the door for potential economic sanctions to be brought against Beijing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> US congressmen say that the renminbi is undervalued, which makes the price of goods that China sells to the US extremely cheap, and adds to the trade imbalance between the US and China.  Last year the US's trade deficit with China reached US $ 232500000000.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> Last night Beijing time, the special hearing held by the FIA World Motor Sports Council in Paris over the Ferrari engineer spy case came to a close.  McLaren, who had been summoned, managed a lucky escape: the council decided not to impose any penalty on McLaren for the time being.</seg>
<seg id="3"> The FIA official website published a statement after the hearing, saying: "Vodafone McLaren Mercedes was in possession of confidential Ferrari information, but at present there is insufficient evidence to show that this information was used improperly in the FIA Formula One World Championship.  Therefore no penalty will be imposed."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> However, this does not definitively close the Ferrari engineer spy case.</seg>
<seg id="5"> The Motor Sports Council also said in this decision: "If it is found in the future that the information relating to Ferrari has been used to the detriment of the championship, we reserve the right to request McLaren to return to WMSC for a hearing.  At that time, they may face the penalty of the cancellation of their qualification to take part in the 2007 championship and even the 2008 championship."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Mike Coughlan, the former chief designer for McLaren who has now been suspended from his job, has been found to have been in possession of nearly 800 pages of Ferrari's technical documents.  The contents included sets of details of the design, power, construction, checks, tests, development and operation of Ferrari's 2007 race car.</seg>
<seg id="7"> McLaren insists that no-one else in the team knew about this information before Coughlan was suspended from his job, and that the McLaren car for this season has no elements from Ferrari.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Experts Think Insurance QDIIs Will Not Divert Funds away from Domestic Stock Market in the Short Term</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Chinanews.com, July 30</seg>
<seg id="3"> According to a report in China Securities Journal, the Provisional Measure for the Overseas Investment with Insurance Funds was recently published, and insurance funding has greater room for operation in the capital markets.</seg>
<seg id="4"> China Life Insurance Company's chief investment officer Liu Lefei thinks that with the renminbi appreciation and the domestic capital markets improving, insurance institutions will not make large investments overseas through foreign currency purchases in the short term.  This also means that insurance QDIIs will not divert funds away from the domestic stock market in the short term.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The report says that quite a few insurance institutions hold the same view.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Experts say that because there is currently no renminbi derivatives market as yet, and the risk-avoidance techniques of insurance institutions are not sufficient, the time is not yet ripe for large-scale foreign currency purchases.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Liu Lefei says that in the long term, in terms of asset allocation, overseas investment should occupy a certain proportion of an insurance company's overall allocation.</seg>
<seg id="8"> However, given the fairly large upwards pressure on the renminbi at present, China Life would mainly be using its own funds in foreign currencies for making overseas investment.</seg>
<seg id="9"> In the current situation it should take a cautious attitude toward purchasing foreign currencies to invest overseas.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> On July 29, the State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters was urgently organizing to deal with the current serious flood control and drought relief situation.</seg>
<seg id="5"> It called on all provinces along the Huai River and the Huai River Flood Control Headquarters to strengthen their dispatch service, to enhance their maintenance of dikes during periods of receding water, and to strive for a complete victory in the Huai River flood prevention and control.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Chinanews.com, July 31  On the 30th Chen Shui-bian questioned that members of the judiciary on the island may have tried to get involved in elections for leaders in the Taiwan region.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Kao Chin-chih, director-general of Taiwan's "Department of Judicial Administration," said on the same day that the current behavior of judges on the island was not as Chen Shui-bian said, and demanded that Chen Shui-bian give an explanation of his comments.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> According to reports in Taiwan's United Daily, Chen Shui-bian questioned on the 30th that for political reasons or electoral considerations, judges, prosecutors or investigators may be interfering with, affecting or even trying to control the campaign activities of candidates from all parties.  He said he hoped that this kind of phenomenon did not exist in Taiwan, but that it was perhaps extremely difficult.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Weng Yueh-sheng, "president of the Judicial Yuan" in Taiwan, kept quiet and made no response to Chen Shui-bian's questions, but "Secretary-General" Fan Kuang-chun sent Kao Chin-chih to make a statement on behalf of the "Judicial Yuan."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Kao Chin-chih said that Taiwan's basic law and the "regulations for judges" both explicitly state that judges should be above party factions, must not take part in political party activities, and must not campaign, either.  Judges were all extremely prudent and respected these relevant restrictions, and the "Judicial Yuan" believed that judges all acquit themselves admirably.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Kao Chin-chih gave an example, saying that "High Court Kaohsiung Branch Court" judge Chang Sheng-hsi took part in a class at the Ketagalan Institute a few years ago, the self-regulation council organized by judges decided to punish him because the relevant syllabus had political party implications.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Once Chang Sheng-hsi wanted to take part in the DPP primaries, but because of controversy over retaining his position and taking part in the election, he decided in the end to give up on it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Kao Chin-chih believes that if it's specific judgments in cases, there is relief available at the court level, and one should not infer that judges have political intentions simply based on wins or losses in the verdicts.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Don't Blindly Worship Legal "Theory Circle"</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> It is stipulated in Article 8 of the draft amendment of the Lawyers Law which has been recently submitted to the NPC standing committee for review that people who were once engaged in the profession of researching and teaching laws and have obtained advanced professional titles or equivalent professional levels may be granted the permission to practice law when their applications for lawyers' licenses pass the review by the judicial administrative department of the State Council.</seg>
<seg id="3"> (June 28, the China Youth Daily)</seg>
<seg id="4"> In the legal community there is a distinction between the "theory circle" and the "practice circle."  The former mainly includes the "abstract activities" such as teaching and researching laws, while the latter is more engaged in the "concrete activities" such as litigation, legal counseling, and legal services.</seg>
<seg id="5"> For a long time there has existed a phenomenon of "scholars' mutual contempt" between the legal "theory circle" and the "practice circle."  The "theory circle" believes that the "practice circle" lacks the necessary legal training and consists only of mechanical "legalists," while the "practice circle" criticizes the "theory circle" by pointing out that "theory cannot direct practice."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> With regard to such a labor division, what the law can do is to maintain neutrality rather than vigorously support either party.</seg>
<seg id="7"> However, the "system of specially licensed lawyers" in the Lawyers Law acknowledges in reality the judgment that the legal "theory circle" is superior to the legal "practice circle."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> In fact, some experts and scholars who have been engaged in the research and teaching of pure legal theories such as the history of the legal system and the international laws have nothing to do with practicing law no matter how profound their theoretical achievements have been.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Thus, the "system of specially licensed lawyers" has doubtlessly opened up a "bad loophole" for confusing qualification in the legal "practice circle" which will have an extremely negative impact.</seg>
<seg id="10"> There is also more blind worship of the "theory circle" than these.  For example, the phenomenon that expert opinions and expert panels frequently influence and even negate court rulings is also a direct manifestation of such blind worship.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> When people go out traveling, they are looking for relaxation, freshness, and freedom, enjoying as much as possible the natural scenery and achievements of civilized society.</seg>
<seg id="3"> However, while traveling in the country, many people have experienced such nuisance as being besieged and cornered by peddlers and middlemen in public places.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Whether you are getting on or off a bus or train, you invariably suffer the harassment of peddlers and some unlicensed middlemen.</seg>
<seg id="5"> They either sell chicken eggs, peanuts, or sesame seed cakes, or newspapers and magazines.  In addition, many unlicensed middlemen make referrals to restaurants and lodgings, even hawking fake certificates, fake receipts, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="6"> If you don't take them, he can chase you for several hundreds of meters as if he would rather die than fail.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> In some scenic spots, many tourists also have the same experience.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Before you enter the main gate, someone would come to hawk things like tourist souvenirs and small pieces of arts and crafts.</seg>
<seg id="9"> There are more scenarios of this kind after you go through the gate, which completely ruins even your best mood.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Some media once reported that many foreign tourists coming to Xi'an praised endlessly the places of historic interest and scenic beauty in Xi'an, but felt it was incomprehensible that crowds of peddlers are allowed to hawk their wares everywhere.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Such public places including bus stations and scenic spots are places meant for traveling and recreation.  Attention should be paid to civility and orderliness as well as tranquility and harmony, providing tourists a comfortable and relaxing environment.</seg>
<seg id="12"> The unrestricted entry and exit of peddlers not only disturb the mood of tourists, but also actually destroy the public order of these public places, giving rise to the visual contamination and environmental contamination, while providing the conditions and opportunities for lawless people to make trouble.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The important thing is that these public places are the windows of spiritual civilization construction in the local areas.  A small glimpse can reveal a larger picture.  Not only the image is being damaged but the growth of local economy will also be impacted.</seg>
<seg id="14"> Just imagine, if you want to expand and strengthen the tourism industry but welcome guests traveling from all directions with such a messy tourist environment, who will still want to come, and who still dare to come?</seg>
<seg id="15"> Then how can your tourist economy gain returns?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> As the tourist high season approaches, creating a civilized tourist environment for tourists coming from all directions should be considered the top priority.</seg>
<seg id="17"> Public places are not markets.  The operation by peddlers should be regulated.  Unlicensed operation must be resolutely banned, and there should be relentless crackdown on illegal activities.</seg>
<seg id="18"> Only a civilized and orderly environment can get tourists to come happily, who will leave after fully enjoying themselves and keep the passion for a return trip.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The Jianguomen Neighborhood in Dongcheng District of Beijing gave away things like refrigerators as rewards to twelve households that voluntarily withdrew from the welfare system.</seg>
<seg id="3"> (The Beijing News, July 10)</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> While feeling happy for these families for the improvement of their lives, this writer is ambivalent toward the proposal of "voluntary withdrawal from the welfare system" and the "reward-giving" method.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The deputy director of the Jianguomen Neighborhood office said, "In response to the issue of the welfare fraud, encouraging voluntary withdrawal from the welfare system aims to set a good example for other households on welfare."</seg>
<seg id="6"> If it is to encourage other welfare recipients to get out of their difficult situations through their own efforts, then this example is indeed worth promoting.  If this is intended to "appeal" to those longtime cheaters of the welfare system, then it may be a bit naive.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Working to distinguish between real and fake welfare recipients and sort them out, we should rely more on the law.</seg>
<seg id="8"> The relevant department should stress the obligations that welfare recipients must carry out while enjoying the welfare: for example, promptly notifying the changes in the family members and incomes, reporting the status of employment, accepting regular reviews, etc.  On the other hand, the relevant department should step up monitoring and inspection.</seg>
<seg id="9"> After all, only "withdrawing from the welfare system according to the law" is the long-term strategy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Who will foot the bill for the material rewards given by the neighborhood to the households that withdrew from the welfare system?</seg>
<seg id="11"> As a level-one government organization, the neighborhood's expenses are covered by the funding from the government budget.</seg>
<seg id="12"> However, is it legitimate to spend this sum of tax payers' money?</seg>
<seg id="13"> On the one hand, households that have withdrawn from the welfare system prove that they have attained certain abilities to be "self-sufficient;" on the other hand, aren't there still people who apply for the welfare?</seg>
<seg id="14"> The funding from the government budget which is called "life-saving" money should be used to provide timely help instead of extra bonus.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Liu Gangyi's Remark about His Willingness to Be a Service Provider Is More Believable</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> On July 10, Liu Gangyi, the party committee secretary of Mulan Township, Xindu District, Chengdu City, who is the first township party committee secretary through public nomination and direct election in the whole country, received his fourth democratic evaluation since he took office.  The rate of satisfaction reached 97%.</seg>
<seg id="3"> During his conversation with reporters, Liu Gangyi defined himself as a "service provider."</seg>
<seg id="4"> (Yesterday, The Beijing News)</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The "service provider" as spoken by Liu Gangyi is probably more truthful and more believable than the "service provider" as spoken by some appointed cadres.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The greatest advantage of public nomination and direct election as compared with the system of appointment lies in the fact that in the former the source of power is mainly determined by ordinary party members and the masses, while in the latter it is mainly appointed by upper-level organizations.  And where the power originates determines that the former must take its  responsibility to the general public as top priority.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The source of power and to whom they should answer are the basic factors that determine how the elected will go about their work.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Some people suspect that this kind of "democratic evaluation" is more like a "democracy show."</seg>
<seg id="9"> My opinion is that it is better to have this form of "democratic evaluation" than nothing at all.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Considering the history and current status of China's grassroots democratic and political construction, I think that it is already a major breakthrough to have public nomination and direction election.  Being a major component of this innovation, the democratic evaluation is not to be underestimated in promoting the grassroots democratic and political construction.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Over the course of the current year, all departments in all parts of Guangxi have launched a movement to transform cadres' style of work and strengthen the building of administrative efficiency in official bodies, implementing the "three systems:" the "ask first" responsibility system, the time-limited case-handling system and the accountability system.   Thirty-three key approval departments directly under the autonomous region and 135 responsible posts have been brought into the administrative efficiency inspection work network.</seg>
<seg id="3"> So far, 619 people have been held to account.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> On the 5th this reporter learned from the Commission for Discipline Inspection of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region that Guangxi has currently formed a rudimentary administrative efficiency inspection work network at the autonomous region, municipality and county levels.  They are strengthening inspection of key departments and responsible posts, and the electronic inspection systems of 14 municipalities have been completely linked with that of the autonomous region.</seg>
<seg id="5"> The autonomous region's electronic system for the inspection of administrative efficiency is directly connected to 33 key approval departments directly under the autonomous region and 135 responsible posts that deal with the investment environment and the production and life of the masses,  further standardizing their approval behavior and raising their approval efficiency.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> At the same time, all levels of Guangxi's discipline inspection supervision bodies are solemnly investigating cases that touch on the efficiency of workstyles or harm the interests of the people.  So far, they have investigated and verified 1104 cases and concluded 769 cases, and held to account 584 work units and 619 individuals.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The secretary of the standing committee of Guangxi Autonomous Region's party committee and discipline inspection committee, Ma Tieshan, said on the 5th that inspection of administrative efficiency is a task that will accompany administrative activities from beginning to end, and it was necessary to gradually put in place a long-term and effective mechanism.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Guangxi is to further perfect and standardize all of its administrative management regulations and systems, and set up and perfect an administrative efficiency inspection work mechanism and safeguard system, so as to put efficiency inspection on an institutionalized  and standardized track; further standandize supervision and inspection procedures, strengthen and improve the complaint resolution mechanism and performance evaluation and assessment mechanism; step up accountability, and use a strict accountability system to ensure the practical implementation of the "ask first" responsibility system, the time-limited case-handling system, and other work systems.</seg>

<seg id="1"> 07-Series Military Uniform Designers Visit China Military Online</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Staff Writer,  Beijing, July 13  Report by Yang Baojin and Correspondent Liu Xinxin: The whole of the army will change into 07-series military uniforms in succession from August 1.</seg>
<seg id="3"> This evening, China Military Online has specially invited Chen Jun, the deputy director of the Clothing and Equipment Office of the Military Supplies and Fuel Division of the General Logistics Department, and Su Yang, senior engineer in the Military Supplies Equipment Research Office of the General Logistics Department and one of the designers of the 07-series military uniforms, to be its guests at China Military Online, and engage in free discussions with netizens both in and outside the army on the background to the development of the new military uniforms and the manufacturing process, provoking a response from the netizens.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The two honored guests directly took part in the design and manufacture of the 07-series military uniforms.</seg>
<seg id="5"> While discussing the changes in the new uniforms, they explained that the 07-series uniforms were designed on the basis of previous uniform changes, in particular, the 97-series uniforms, and had made improvements in seven areas, including the uniform series, standards, and styles, totaling hundreds of items.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The greatest feature of the 07-series uniforms is that it has reflected the requirements for serialization, functionalization and personalization, allowing our army's military uniform to achieve standards in terms of coordination among the three armed services, completeness of varieties and the way the series forms a set for the first time.  This signifies the realization of a historical leap in the level of our army's military uniform development.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The two honored guests also carried out wide-ranging exchanges with the netizens on issues such as the new uniforms' types, styles, specifications, and accessories.</seg>
</p>

<seg id="1"> When You Start Well, You Still Need to Finish Well</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Judging simply from the result of the match, 2-2 seems a reasonable score, and is also one that the Chinese team can accept.  The key problem is that the way the match went made people feel it was rather a pity.</seg>
<seg id="3"> If the Iranian team had taken a 2-0 lead, then the Chinese team had evened up the score, then the feeling that would have given China's sports fans would certainly have been different.  It would have boosted morale.  The pity was that the situation was precisely the opposite.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> You could say that starting well but being unable to finish well is an old problem of the Chinese team.</seg>
<seg id="5"> The Chinese team often don't kick the ball when they have an excellent chance, and most people's view is that the psychological quality of China's players is not really up to it.</seg>
<seg id="6"> This is actually one reason why the Chinese team cannot "finish well."</seg>
<seg id="7"> However, judging by the Chinese team's match today, it may not be quite so.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Even if we set aside the fact that Sun Jihai, Sun Xiang, Shao Jiayi, Zheng Zhi and others have played in Europe, Li Weifeng and others are also old-timers with long experience of the battlefield.  They have experience and knowledge, and so it would be reasonable to say that there should not be any problem with their psychological quality.</seg>
<seg id="9"> The reason why the Chinese team was regrettably forced to a draw by the Iranian team this time may be because they deployed their forces in a lackadaisical manner at key points of the match.</seg>
<seg id="10"> When the Iranian team were behind, they substituted two persons, and the scene immediately seemed different.</seg>
<seg id="11"> In the second half, the Chinese team also substituted three players, but without a positive effect.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> To overcome the problem of starting well but being unable to finish well, it is definitely necessary to pinpoint the source of the problem.</seg>
<seg id="13"> As long as the problem is correctly grasped, it will probably not be difficult to find a way to get rid of the problem.</seg>
<seg id="14"> The worst thing when you have a serious illness is just to go to see any doctor.</seg>
<seg id="15"> If they carry on like this, no matter how many matches the Chinese team play, the old problem will still continue, and the constant progress with every game that everyone expects will be out of the question.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, London,  July 2  Icelandic scientists have discovered through research that the risk of arrhythmia among people with two types of genetic variation in their bodies is far greater than among ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="3"> According to a report in the latest issue of Nature magazine, after researchers at Iceland's deCode Genetics Inc sifted through the genes of thousands of people from Iceland, Sweden, and the US, as well as China's Hong Kong region, they made the above-mentioned discovery.</seg>
<seg id="4"> The two genes discovered by the scientists are located close to a gene that plays an important role in the early growth of the heart.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Arrhythmia, namely atrial fibrillation, is one of the most common clinically observed irregularities of the rhythm of the heart, and can lead to heart palpitations, shortness of breath, tiredness as well as apoplectic fits.</seg>
<seg id="6"> And according to a report in the Nature Genetics magazine that came out on the 1st, researchers at deCode Genetics Inc have also discovered two genes on the 17th chromosome in human beings that is connected to the onset of cancer in the prostate gland.

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Maracaibo (Venezuela) July 3 (Correspondent Liu Jian)</seg>
<seg id="3"> According to a report in the Venezuelan media on the 3rd, the US team's 37-year-old veteran goalkeeper, Keller, said during an interview here that if he could not find a suitable club to serve in after the America's Cup, then he would opt to retire.</seg>
<seg id="4"> "If I have not been able to get a contract for 1-2 seasons with a high-quality league team within four to six weeks of the conclusion of the America's Cup, then maybe retiring will not be a bad choice for me."</seg>
<seg id="5"> With the relegation of the Möchengladbach team to the 2nd Bundesliga, Keller also left this soccer team in which he had served for more than two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Although Keller has a mind to retire, he has many opportunities and clearly need not worry about finding a place.  He himself has frankly stated that there are currently as many as eight soccer teams that are interested in inviting him to join them.</seg>
<seg id="7"> However, this veteran goalkeeper who has served in league matches for the Spanish Primera Liga, the English Premiership, and the German Bundesliga, said that what he ultimately chooses to do will be decided by his family.  "My kid is already 9 years old.  He has followed me around and stayed in three different countries, and has been to three different schools, and so I need to consider in my current choice what would be better for my family."</seg>
<seg id="8"> In the Gold Cup competition that was concluded not long ago, Keller put in an outstanding performance, helping the US team to win the title.</seg>
<seg id="9"> In the current America's cup, he has, just as before, been given an important job to do by head coach Bradley, but he clearly cannot win the match singlehanded.  The US team, made up of "young guards," is no match for such strong South American opponents as Argentina and Paraguay, and during these two matches the goal he guarded was breached seven times.</seg>
<seg id="10"> The next match against Colombia will probably be the US team's and Keller's last performance in this America's Cup competition.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="3"> US diplomats said Paulson was first headed to Xining, the capital of the vast northwestern province of Qinghai.</seg>
<seg id="4"> China is currently implementing a series of environmental protection initiatives near the largest salt-water lake in Qinghai Province.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Paulson left for Beijing today to discuss with Chinese officials in charge topics such as promotion of the US-China Strategic Economic Dialogue launched last year .</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The US-China Strategic Economic Dialogue mainly covers economic, environmental and other issues, but the one at the forefront is the exchange rate of RMB, which is seen by lawmakers in the United States as significantly undervalued.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> There has been growing pressure within the US as the US trade deficit with China soars. US lawmakers plan to take retaliatory actions to fight against what they call unfair trade policies of China.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Last week the US Senate Finance Committee overwhelmingly approved a bill requiring the Treasury to identify nations with "fundamentally misaligned" currencies, potentially opening the door to economic sanctions against Beijing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> US lawmakers say the undervalued RMB makes US-bound goods from China extremely cheap, thereby exacerbating trade imbalance between the US and China, with the US trade deficit with China hitting US $ 232500000000 last year.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> Beijing time yesterday, an extraordinary hearing held by the FIA World Motor Sport Council on the Ferrari technical spy case ended in Paris, where the summoned McLaren team escaped a disaster: the council decided not to penalize McLaren for the moment.</seg>
<seg id="3"> The FIA official website issued a statement following the hearing, which says, "the Vodafone McLaren Mercedes team was in possession of confidential Ferrari information, but presently there is insufficient evidence that this information was used improperly in the FIA Formula One World Championship. Therefore, no penalty is imposed."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> However, the Ferrari technical spy case did not come to an end at this point.</seg>
<seg id="5"> The WMSC also said in the decision, "if it is found in the future that relevant Ferrari information has been used to the detriment of the championship, we reserve the right to request the McLaren team back to a hearing of the WMSC where it may face the penalty of being excluded from not only the 2007 season but also the 2008 season."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Mike Coughlan, the suspended former McLaren chief designer, was found to possess a nearly 800-page Ferrari technical dossier, which covered a series of aspects of Ferrari 2007 racers, including design, power, construction, examination, test, development and running.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> July 30 chinanews.com</seg>
<seg id="3"> According to a report in the China Securities, with the introduction of the Interim Regulations Governing Overseas Investment of Insurance Capitals the other day, insurance capitals have broader room to take advantage of the capital market.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Liu Lefei, Chief Investment Officer of China Life Co., Ltd, believes that due to the appreciation of RMB and promising domestic capital market, insurance institutions will not invest overseas by buying foreign currencies on a large scale in the short run, which means insurance QDII will not drain cash from the domestic stock market anytime soon.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The report says quite a few insurance institutions hold the same view.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Experts say in the absence of a derivatives market for RMB, insurance institutions lack sufficient hedging measures. It is therefore not yet time to buy foreign currencies on a large scale.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Liu Lefei said that in the long run, in terms of asset allocation, overseas investment should have some weight in the overall allocation of insurance companies.</seg>
<seg id="8"> However, given the fairly large upward pressure of RMB at present, China Life will primarily use its own foreign reserves for overseas investment.</seg>
<seg id="9"> As for investing overseas by buying foreign currencies, caution should be taken under the current circumstances.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> July 31 chinanews.com - Chen Shui-bian on the 30th questioned the island's judicial personnel for intervention into the leadership elections of the Taiwan region.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Kao Chin-chih, "Director-General of the Department of Judicial Administration at the Judicial Yuan" of Taiwan said on the same day that the current behaviors of judges on the island were inconsistent with what Chen Shui-bian said, and he demanded that Chen Shui-bian explain his comments.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> According to a report in Taiwan's United Daily, Chen Shui-bian on the 30th questioned judges, prosecutors and investigators for intervening, influencing or even attempting to manipulate election campaigns of candidates from different parties out of political factors or election considerations and said he hoped the phenomenon did not exist in Taiwan, but it might be very difficult.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> In response to Chen Shui-bian's questioning, President of Taiwan "Judicial Yuan" Weng Yueh-sheng kept a low key with no responses, while "Secretary-General" Fan Kuang-chun appointed Kao Chin-chih to speak on behalf of the "Judicial Yuan."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Kao Chin-chih said both the fundamental law of Taiwan and "Judges Code of Conduct" state explicitly that judges should stay beyond parties and must not participate in party activities or assist with election campaigns; all judges have carefully observed relevant restrictions and the "Judicial Yuan" believes all judges are behaving very well.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Kao Chin-chih noted by giving an example, when Judge Jang Shenq-shii of Kaohsiung "Branch High Court" attended a program at the Ketagalan Institute several years ago, he was immediately decided to be punished by the self-regulation panel comprised of judges due to the partisan tint of relevant courses.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Jang Shenq-shii once wanted to run in the primary for the Progressive Party but eventually decided to quit, again amid controversy over his participation while in office.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Kao Chin-chih believes if it is the trial of an individual case, there is recourse to the appeal process. One should not infer the judge has ulterior political motives solely based on the result of the ruling.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Don't Worship Legal "Theorists" Blindly</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> It is stipulated in Article 8 of the Draft Amendment to the Attorneys Law recently submitted to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress for review that those who apply for practicing as an attorney and have senior professional designations or equivalent professional levels from previous professional work such as legal research and teaching, can be permitted to practice as a lawyer upon approval of the justice department of the State Council.</seg>
<seg id="3"> (June 28, China Youth Daily)</seg>
<seg id="4"> There are "theorists" and "practitioners" in law, where the former primarily involve "abstract behaviors" such as legal teaching and research, while the latter are more of "concrete behaviors" such as litigations, legal counseling and legal services.</seg>
<seg id="5"> For a long time, there has been mutual contempt between legal "theorists" and "practitioners." "Theorists" think "practitioners" are merely mechanical "legal dogmatists" lacking necessary attainments in the science of law, while criticisms of "practitioners" about "theorists" are directed at the "inability of theories to guide practice."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Given such gap in the division of labor, what law can do is to remain neutral rather than strongly support either of the two.</seg>
<seg id="7"> However, the "chartered attorney system" in the Attorneys Law recognizes the opinion factually that legal "theorists" are superior to legal "practitioners."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> In reality, for some experts and scholars who study and teach pure legal theories such as the legal history and international law, no matter how profound and sophisticated their theories are, they are incompatible with legal practice.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Thus, the "chartered attorney system" has undoubtedly created a "bad opening" to confusions in legal "practitioner" qualifications, which has extremely adverse influence.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Blind worship of "theorists" does not stop here. Phenomena where reports of expert opinions and expert argumentation seminars often affect and even override court verdicts are also direct reflections of such blind worship.</seg>

<seg id="3"> The reporter learned from a press conference of the State Council Information Office that beginning July 1 this year, China would implement an ad hoc tax-free registration policy for Chinese-funded vessels engaged in international shipping to encourage Chinese-funded ships flying foreign flags to register back in China, acquire the PRC nationality and operate under the Five-Starred Red Flag.</seg>
<seg id="4"> To further promote sound development of our nation's maritime industry and expand the national fleet, in response to relevant problems arising from the significant number of our vessels engaged in international voyages that register overseas and operate under foreign flags, the Ministry of Communications recently issued an Announcement on Implementing Ad Hoc Tax-Free Registration Policy for Chinese-Funded Vessels Engaged in International Shipping, which specifies the conditions and application procedures of enjoying the ad hoc tax-free registration policy. Eligible vessels are exempt from customs duty and import VAT if they submit import declarations within two years beginning July 1 this year.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Traveling away from home, the aim is to be relaxed, refreshed and comfortable and to enjoy natural scenery and the achievements of social civilization to the maximum extent.</seg>
<seg id="3"> However, when traveling domestically, many people have experienced such annoyance, which is being blocked in public places by peddlers and those doing agent businesses.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> No matter in a bus or a train, they are always persistently harassed by peddlers and illegal agents whenever getting on or off the vehicle.</seg>
<seg id="5"> If they are not selling eggs, peanuts or pies, then they are selling newspapers or magazines. Others are a large number of illegal agents who recommend restaurants or accommodations, or even peddle fake invoices.</seg>
<seg id="6"> If you don't accept, they may follow you several hundred meters, quite an air of I would rather die if I don't succeed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> At some scenic spots, many tourists feel the same way.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Before you even enter the gate, there will be someone peddling things like tourist souvenirs and small crafts.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Once you enter, there will be even more such things. Even the best mood will be dispelled.</seg>
<seg id="10"> A media agency once reported that while many foreign tourists to Xi'an were amazed by the famous and historic sites in Xi'an, they felt perplexed by piles of vendors and peddlers selling goods everywhere.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Public places like bus stops and scenic spots are supposed to be places for traveling and relaxing, where courtesy, order, quietness and harmony should prevail, so as to give tourists a comfortable and easy environment.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Free entry and exit of peddlers not only disturb tourists' moods, but also virtually destruct the public order at these public places, thus creating visual pollution and environmental pollution. In addition, it also provides conditions and opportunities for lawbreakers to stir up troubles.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> What's important is that these public places are the window showcasing local cultural and ideological progress. Seeing a spot reveals the whole picture. What is damaged is not only a question of image, but it will also affect local economic development.</seg>
<seg id="14"> Just imagine, you want to make your tourism industry big and strong, but use such messy tourist environment to greet guests from around the world. Who will want to come, and who will dare to come?</seg>
<seg id="15"> Then, how does your tourism economy yield any benefits?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> With the high season coming for tourism, it should be a priority to create a civilized tourism environment for tourists from all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="17"> Public places are not markets. Business activities of vendors and peddlers should be regulated. Those who operate without a license should be firmly removed, and illegal activities should be firmly suppressed.</seg>
<seg id="18"> Only a civilized and orderly environment will make tourists come, go and return gladly.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> By giving away things like refrigerators, the Jianguomen subdistrict of Beijing's Dongcheng district has awarded 12 households enjoying the minimum living allowance for opting out of the minimum living standard scheme.</seg>
<seg id="3"> (The Beijing News - July 10)</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The author is happy for these households for the improvement in their living, but has mixed feelings towards the term "opting out of the minimum living standard scheme" and the practice of "awarding."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> "Regarding problems such as cheating on the minimum living allowance, encouraging people to opt out of the minimum living standard scheme is to set examples for other households enjoying the minimum living allowances," Deputy Director at the Jianguomen Subdistrict Office said.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Such examples are indeed worth promoting if they are to encourage other people enjoying the minimum living allowance to get out of difficulties through their own efforts; they are, however, a bit naive if the purpose is to "move" those who have cheated on the minimum living allowance for long.</seg>
<seg id="7"> In distinguishing between and cleaning up real and fake households entitled to the minimum living allowance, what should be relied on more is the law.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Competent authorities should highlight the obligations of households entitled to the minimum living allowance while they enjoy the minimum living standard allowance: for example, informing of changes in family members and income in a timely manner, reporting the employment situation, undergoing regular reviews etc. And competent authorities should intensify supervision and inspection.</seg>
<seg id="9"> After all, "withdrawal from the minimum living standard scheme pursuant to law" is the permanent solution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Who will pay for the in-kind rewards given by the subdistrict to the households who opt out of the minimum living standard scheme?</seg>
<seg id="11"> As a level of governmental organizations, the spending of a subdistrict is covered by fiscal allocation.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Yet should this money of the taxpayers be spent?</seg>
<seg id="13"> On the one hand, by opting out of the minimum living standard scheme, the households prove to have certain capacity to "sustain themselves;" on the other hand, aren't there still people claiming the minimum living standard allowance?</seg>
<seg id="14"> The government's fiscal allocation that is dubbed life-saving money should provide timely assistance rather than add icing to a cake.</seg>

<seg id="3"> In the reporter's conversation with Liu Gangyi, Liu Gangyi positioned himself as a "servant."</seg>
<seg id="4"> (The Beijing News - a day ago)</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The "servant" uttered by Liu Gangyi may be more real and convincing than the "servant" uttered by those appointed officials.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The biggest advantage of public nomination and direct election, compared with the mechanism of appointment, is that with the former, the source of authority is primarily decided by average party members and commoners, while the latter are appointed by a higher organizational level. And the direction of the source of authority determines the former must place their responsibility for the public at the top.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The source of authority and who to report to are the fundamental factors that decide how the elected go about their work.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Some people question such "democratic assessment," saying it is more like a "show of democracy."</seg>
<seg id="9"> My view is that it is better to have this form of "democratic assessment" than nothing.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Considering the history and current situation of the grassroot democracy progress in China, I believe public nomination and direct election are already a major breakthrough. As an important part of this innovation, democratic assessment should not be underestimated in advancing the grassroot democracy progress.</seg>

<seg id="2"> BEIJING, July 13, by the newspaper (Yang Jinbao and Reporter Liu Xinxin) The entire armed forces will gradually switch over to Type 07 military uniforms starting from August 1.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Tonight, China Military Online has specially invited Chen Jun, Deputy Director of the Clothing and Equipment Office of the Military Supplies and POL Section of the General Logistics Department, and Su Yang, senior engineer at the Quartermaster Equipment Institute of the General Logistics Department and one of the designers of Type 07 military uniforms, to China Military Online, to chat with net buddies in and outside the military about the story behind the birth of the new military uniforms and their development process, which was well responded among netizens.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The two guests were direct participants in the design and development of Type 07 military uniforms.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Speaking of changes in the new military uniforms, they revealed that the Type 07 military uniforms were designed on the basis of historical uniform upgrades, especially the Type 97 military uniforms, with as many as several hundred refinements in seven aspects, including the series, designs and styles of the military uniforms.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The biggest feature of Type 07 military uniforms is that they reflect the demands for serialization, functionality and humanization, which for the first time enables our army to meet the standards of harmonization among the three armed forces, having a complete range of items and having a series of accessories, marking a historical leap forward in the level of military uniform development of our army.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The two guests also communicated on a broad range of issues regarding the new military uniforms with net buddies, which include items, styles, sizes and wearing.</seg>

<seg id="1"> A Good Start Calls for a Good Ending</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Solely from the result of the game, a score of 2-2 is reasonable and also acceptable to the Chinese team. What's essential is the process of the game, which is somewhat disappointing.</seg>
<seg id="3"> If it was the Iranian team who led 2-0 before the Chinese team equalized the score, this would definitely give Chinese soccer fans different feelings and significantly boost morale. Unfortunately, things were just the opposite.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> A good start without a good ending could be said a chronic problem of the Chinese team.</seg>
<seg id="5"> The Chinese team often does not know how to play soccer under favorable circumstances. The conventional view is that Chinese players have less than satisfactory psychological quality.</seg>
<seg id="6"> This is indeed a reason why the Chinese team could not have a "good ending."</seg>
<seg id="7"> However, seen from today's game of the Chinese team, it seems this is not completely true.</seg>
<seg id="8"> People like Li Weifeng are experienced veteran players, let alone people like Sun Jihai, Sun Xiang, Shao Jiayi and Zheng Zhi who have played soccer in Europe. They have broad experience and knowledge, and should not have problematic psychological quality logically speaking.</seg>
<seg id="9"> The Chinese team was unfortunately forced into a draw by the Iranian team this time, most probably because of improper deployment of players.</seg>
<seg id="10"> The Iranian team substituted with two people while trailing behind and the situation improved instantly.</seg>
<seg id="11"> The Chinese team also substituted with three players, but the result was not good.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> To overcome the problem of having a good start without a good ending, the source of the problem must be spotted.</seg>
<seg id="13"> As long as the problem is spotted, it may not be difficult to find a solution to redress the problem.</seg>
<seg id="14"> What we fear is to see a doctor indiscriminately in case of an emergency disease.</seg>
<seg id="15"> If things go on like that, the chronic problem will persist no matter how many games the Chinese team plays, not to mention a step forward in each game that people expect.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> MARACAIBO (Venezuela), July 3, Xinhua (Reporter Liu Jian)</seg>
<seg id="3"> According to reports of the Venezuelan media on the 3rd, 37-year old US veteran goalkeeper Keller said in an interview here that he would choose to retire if he couldn't find an appropriate club to play for after Copa America.</seg>
<seg id="4"> "If in four to six weeks after Copa America I'm still unable to secure a contract for one or two seasons in a high-level league club, then retirement may not be a bad choice for me.</seg>
<seg id="5"> "With Monchengladbach relegated to Germany's second division, Keller left the team for which he played for more than two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Although Keller has the intention to stop, he, "still waiting for a boss at home," apparently doesn't have to worry about his next employment. He admitted that up to eight teams had made offers for him to join so far.</seg>
<seg id="7"> However, the veteran goalkeeper who has played in the Primera división de Liga, English Premier League and Bundesliga, said how he would choose finally would depend on his family, "my child is already nine years old and he has been in three different countries and three different schools with me. My choice now will consider what is better for my family."</seg>
<seg id="8"> In the Gold Cup that ended not long ago, Keller helped the US team win the title with outstanding performance.</seg>
<seg id="9"> During this year's Copa America, while he was again entrusted with an important task by Head Coach Bradley, nevertheless he could hardly resist so many players with a single fist. The US team, embarking on the expedition as the "young guards," was not at all rivals of such strong South American teams as Argentina and Paraguay. In two matches, the goal he kept was broken seven times.</seg>
<seg id="10"> The next match against the Colombian team may well be the last performance of the US team and Keller in this year's Copa America.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The talks, held in the border city of Panmunjom, entered the last day of the agenda today. North Korean chief delegate Lieutenant Kim Yong Chol (transliteration) stated, "We've come to the conclusion that we don't need these fruitless talks any more."</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> U.S. Treasury Secretary Paulson arrived in China yesterday for a visit. The United States is exerting all efforts in convincing China to further implement necessary economic reforms and environmental protection work, particularly the Renminbi exchange rate topic that had attracted wide attention.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> U.S. diplomat stated that Paulson visited Xining City, the capital of major Chinese northwestern province Qinghai, earlier.</seg>
<seg id="4"> China is currently implementing a series of environmental protection plans near the largest salt-water lake in Qinghai Province.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Paulson traveled to Beijing today to discuss with chief Chinese officials on topics including the acceleration of the process of the 'US-China Strategic Economic Dialogue' initiated last year.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The US-China Strategic Economic Dialogue mainly discusses economic and environmental protection issues with Renminbi exchange rate being the most important one. U.S. congressmen argued that the value of Renminbi is underestimated.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The US-China trade deficit is soaring. Pressure inside the United States is increasing. Congressmen are preparing to adopt retaliatory measures to counter their so-called "unfair China trade policy".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Last week, the U.S. Senate Finance Committee overwhelmingly adopted a bill requiring the Treasury Department to identify list of nations with "fundamentally misaligned" currency exchange rate, thus opening a potential door to economic sanctions against Beijing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> U.S. congressmen said that an undervalued Renminbi makes goods exported from China to the United States very inexpensive, thus intensifying the US-China trade deficit. The US-China trade deficit had reached US $ 232500000000 last year.</seg>

<seg id="2"> The special hearing held by the World Motor Sport Council for the Ferrari technology espionage case ended in Paris last night Beijing time. McLaren, the racing team being summoned, escaped misfortune: The council decided not to penalize McLaren racecar team for the time being.</seg>
<seg id="3"> The official website of the World Motor Sport Council published a declaration after the hearing that said, "Vodafone McLaren Mercedes was in possession of confidential Ferrari information. However, there is insufficient evidence that this information was used in such a way as to interfere improperly with the FIA Formula One World Championship. We therefore impose no penalty."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Nonetheless, the Ferrari technology espionage case did not end here.</seg>
<seg id="5"> The World Motor Sport Council also stated in the decision, ""But if it is found in the future that the Ferrari information has been used to the detriment of the championship, we reserve the right to invite Vodafone McLaren Mercedes back in front of the WMSC where it will face the possibility of exclusion from not only the 2007 championship but also the 2008 championship."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Mike Coughlan, former chief designer of McLaren who has now been terminated, was found to possess nearly 800 pages of Ferrari technical dossier containing a whole set of interconnections including the design, power, building, inspection, testing, development, and running of the 2007 Ferrari race cars.</seg>

<seg id="3"> According to report of China Securities, the Interim Administrative Measures for the Management of Offshore Investments of Insurance Funds was promulgated a few days ago. Insurance funds thus have wider room for utilization in the capital market.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Liu Lefei, Chief Investment Officer at China Life Insurance, believed that with the appreciation of the Renminbi and the strong domestic capital market, insurance institutions will not engage in large-scale offshore investments through foreign exchange purchase. This also implies that the Insurance QDII will not divert funds in domestic stock market in the near future.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The report stated that many insurance institutions shared the same view.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Expert stated that since a Renminbi derivative market still does not exist at the present moment, insurance institutions do not have adequate measures to avert risk. Therefore, conditions are not yet ripe for large-scale foreign exchange purchase.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Liu Lefei said that in the long run, in the area of asset allocation, offshore investments should make up a considerable portion in the overall allocation of insurance companies.</seg>
<seg id="8"> However, since the Renminbi has rather huge appreciation pressure at present, China Life Insurance will mainly utilize exchange funds that it has in offshore investments.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Chinanews.com, July 31 - Chen Shui-bian on the 30th raised doubts about attempts of judicial members in the island to intervene in the election of Taiwan regional leaders.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Kao Chin-chih, "Director-General of the Department of Judicial Administration" in Taiwan, stated on the same day that judges in the island are behaving differently from what Chen Shui-bian described and demanded an explanation from Chen Shui-bian for his remark.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> According to report of the United Daily News of Taiwan, Chen Shui-bian raised doubts about judges, prosecutors, and investigators intervened, influenced, and even attempted to control the election campaigns of various party candidates out of political factors or consideration for the elections. He claimed that he hoped this situation does not exist in Taiwan but it may be extremely difficult.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> In response to the doubt of Chen Shui-bian, Weng Yueh-sheng, "President of the Judicial Yuan" in Taiwan maintained a low-key and did not respond while "Secretary-General" Fan Kuang-chun appointed Kao Chin-chih to speak for the Judicial Yuan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Kao Chin-chih stated that the Fundamental Law of Taiwan and the "judges' rules and regulations" both proclaim in explicit terms that judges should transcend political parties and groups. They cannot participate in activities of political parties or assist in the campaign. Judges all follow relevant restraints cautiously. The Judicial Yuan believed that all judges have done well.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Kao Chin-chih quoted an example by saying that Chang Sheng-hsi, judge of the "Kaohsiung Branch of the Supreme Court", took part in the course offered by the Ketagalan Institute a few years ago. Since the related course had party flavor, the self-disciplinary committee formed by judges decided to take disciplinary action against him.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Chang Sheng-hsi once wanted to run in the primary election of the Democratic Progressive Party but due to the controversy over running in the election while in office, he finally decided to give up.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Kao Chin-chih argued that if it is for the trial of individual case, one can lodge an appeal to the court of higher instance. One cannot infer that judges have other political intentions solely based on the outcome of the verdict.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Don't Have Blind Faith in Legal "Theoretical Circle"</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Article 8 of the draft amendment of the Law on Lawyers recently submitted to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress for deliberation stipulates: people who have professional experiences in the research or teaching of law, with advanced professional titles or corresponding professional competence, may obtain a lawyer's license, and get approval from judicial departments under the State Council.</seg>
<seg id="3"> (June 28, China Youth Daily)</seg>
<seg id="4"> There is a difference between the "theoretical circle" and the "practical circle" in law. The former mainly includes "abstract behaviors" such as the teaching and research of law while the latter are more "concrete behaviors" such as engaging in litigations, legal consultations, and legal services.</seg>
<seg id="5"> The phenomenon of "scorning of each other" has long existed between the theoretical circle and the practical circle in law. The theoretical circle argues that the practical circle lacks necessary legal attainments and is simply mechanical "legalist" while the direction of criticism of the practical circle on the theoretical circle is that "theories cannot guide practice".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> In regards to such a divergence of division of labor, what law can do is to remain neutral instead of supporting any one side with mightiness.</seg>
<seg id="7"> However, the "chartered lawyer system" in the Law on Lawyers has objectively endorsed the judgment that the theoretical circle is superior to the practical circle in law.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> In fact, for some experts and scholars who engage in pure research and teaching of legal theories such as the history of legal system and international laws, no matter how thoroughly accomplished they are in theories, they will still be out of step with practical legal issues.</seg>
<seg id="9"> In this case, chartered lawyer system has no doubt set a "bad precedent" with extremely harmful effects on the qualification confusion in the practical circle in law.</seg>
<seg id="10"> The blind faith in the theoretical circle is not only limited to these. For instance, expert submissions and expert appraisal meetings always influence and even veto court verdicts. This phenomenon is also a direct manifestation of such blind faith.</seg>

<seg id="3"> However, when traveling in China, many people encounter such an annoyance of being encircled, pursued, obstructed, and intercepted by peddlers and people engage in intermediary businesses in public places.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> When people getting on or off the vehicle, no matter car or train, they are always pestered by peddlers and some unlicensed middlemen.</seg>

<seg id="10"> The media once reported that many foreign visitors to Xi'an spoke very highly of the scenic spots and historical sites of Xi'an. However, they could not understand why heaps of peddlers were allowed to peddle everywhere.</seg>
</p>

<seg id="12"> Not only does the come and go at will of the peddlers disturb visitors' mood, objectively, they have disrupted the public order of these public places and caused visual and environmental pollution, and at the same time, it also provides conditions and opportunities to lawbreakers to incite trouble.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The Jianguomen neighborhood office in Dongcheng District, Beijing handed out items such as refrigerators as rewards for 12 low-income subsidy recipient families that voluntarily  surrendered their low-income subsidies.</seg>
<seg id="3"> (The Beijing News, July 10)</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The author is happy about the improvements in life of these families. However, I have mixed feelings about the wording of "voluntary surrender of low-income subsidy" and the practice of "giving out rewards".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Vice-chairman of Jianguomen neighborhood office said, "In order to address problems including defrauding low-income subsidy and so on, encouraging voluntary surrender of low-income subsidy is to set an example for other low-income subsidy recipient households."</seg>
<seg id="6"> If this example encourages other low-income subsidy recipients to turn the corner through efforts of their own, then it is indeed worth promoting. However, if one wants to use this to "inspire" people who have been defrauding low-income subsidy for a long time, then it is somewhat naive.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The work to differentiate and straighten up real and false low-income subsidy recipient households should rely more on the law.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Relevant departments should strengthen responsibilities that low-income subsidy recipient households need to fulfill when enjoying low-income subsidy: For example, inform changes in number of family members and income in a timely manner, report employment situation, and subjected to regular review. Meanwhile, relevant departments should step up efforts in supervision and inspection.</seg>
<seg id="9"> After all, only the "surrender of low-income subsidy according to the law" is the long-term plan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Who pays for the material rewards given to families that surrender their low-income subsidies by the neighborhood office?</seg>
<seg id="11"> As a level-one government agency, the expenses of the neighborhood office are shouldered by financial appropriation.</seg>
<seg id="12"> Then, should this sum of taxpayers' money be spent?</seg>
<seg id="13"> On the one hand, families that surrender their low-income subsidies have proven that they have certain abilities to be 'self-sufficient". On the other hand, aren't there still people who apply for low-income subsidy?</seg>
<seg id="14"> Government appropriation that is labeled as life-saving money should render timely help instead of making what is good still better.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> On July 10, Liu Gangyi, the first Secretary of the township Party committee publicly nominated and directly elected in the country and the Secretary of the Party committee of Mulan Town in Xindu District, Chengdu City was subjected to democratic evaluation for the fourth time since he took office. He had an approval rating of 97 percent.</seg>
<seg id="3"> In the conversation between Liu Gangyi and the reporter, Liu Gangyi defined himself as "one who serves others".</seg>
<seg id="4"> (Yesterday, the Beijing News)</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The "one who serves others" that Liu Gangyi referred to is perhaps more truthful and convincing than "the one who serves others" referred to by some appointed cadres.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The biggest advantage of public nomination and direct election over appointment system is that it is mainly ordinary Party members and the people who determine the origin of the power of the former while the latter is mainly appointed by higher-level organizations, whereas the direction from which power originates has established that the former must give accountability to the people top priority.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The origin of power and to whom one is responsibleare fundamental factors in deciding how an electee conducts his work.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Some people challenge that such a "democratic evaluation" is more like a "democracy show".</seg>
<seg id="9"> My opinion is that having such form of democratic evaluation is better than not having any.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Given considerations to the history and current situation of the building of democratic politics at the grassroots level in China, I believe that direct public election is already a major breakthrough. Democratic evaluation is an important component of this unprecedented undertaking. It should not be underestimated in the advancement of building democratic politics at the grassroots level.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> On June 23, Patil put her palms together before filling out the presidential candidate documents.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The presidential election in India has begun on the 19th. The new president will emerge between the incumbent Vice President Shekawat and Pratibha Patil, the governor of Rajasthan who resigned not long ago.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Patil is the first female presidential candidate in India's history. If she is elected, she will become India's first woman president ever.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Patil is the presidential candidate of the ruling Congress Party while Shekawat is from the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Since the Congress Party has the upper hand in the presidential election, the media and the people all suspect that Patil has a relative high possibility of being elected.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Patil, 72, was the woman governor of Rajasthan.</seg>
<seg id="8"> She was a lawyer and joined the Congress in 1985. She is seasoned in politics. During her term as the governor of Rajasthan, she had received high opinions from the government.</seg>
<seg id="9"> She also devotes herself to social welfare and is the honorary chairman of many cultural, educational, and social welfare organizations.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Analysts pointed out that the reason Patil became the candidate was that she has pledged her allegiance steadfastly to Sonia Gandhi, the Chairman of the Congress Party.</seg>
<seg id="11"> In India, the Gandhi family has been controlling the ruling National Party for a long time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Patil has the support of many woman voters, who believe that Patil will rebuild the image of women and raise their status in India where the conception of discrimination against women is serious.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The Constitution stipulates that India is a federal state. The president is the ceremonial head of the state and the chief commander of the armed forces. He/she does not represent any party or organization and is more of a symbol.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> This newspaper, Beijing, July 13, Reported by Yang Baojin, Reporter Liu Xinxin: All forces of the entire army will gradually change to wear the 07 style army uniforms starting August 1.</seg>
<seg id="3"> Tonight, the China Military Online specially invited Deputy Director Chen Jun of the Clothing and Equipment Office of Military Supply and POL Section of the General Logistics Department together with Su Yang, the senior engineer at the Quartermaster Equipment Institute of the General Logistics Department and one of the designers of the 07 style army uniforms, to serve as guests of the China Military Online to discuss the background of the emergence of the new army uniforms and their development process with netizens inside and outside the army. The discussion was well received by the netizens.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The two guests were direct participants of the design and development of the 07 style army uniforms.</seg>
<seg id="5"> In their discussion on the changes of the new army uniforms, they explained that the design of the 07 style army uniforms was based on all previous uniform changes, particularly the 97 style army uniforms. Several hundred refinements had been made to seven areas including the series, system, and style of the army uniforms.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The biggest characteristic of the 07 style army uniforms is that they have manifested the requirements for serialization, functionality, and humanity, thus enable our army uniforms to reach the standards of coordination of the three services, completeness of assortment, and variety of accessories for the first time. It signifies a historical leap in the production level of our army uniforms.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Good Start Still Needs to See Things Through</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The 2-2 score was reasonable and was acceptable to the Chinese team if judging from the result of the game alone. The key was that the process of the game was somewhat regrettable.</seg>
<seg id="3"> If the Iranian team led by 2-0, then the Chinese team tied the score, that would definitely make Chinese fans feel very differently. It would bolster a lot of morale. Unfortunately, the situation was precisely the opposite.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Fails to see things through can be considered as an old problem of the Chinese team.</seg>
<seg id="5"> The Chinese team never knows how to play under excellent situation. The general opinion is that mentally Chinese players are not tough enough.</seg>
<seg id="6"> This is indeed a reason that the Chinese team fails to "see things through".</seg>
<seg id="7"> However, judging from the game that the Chinese team played today, it seems that it is not necessarily so.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Not only had Sun Jihai, Sun Xiang, Shao Jiayi, and Zheng Zhi played in Europe before, Li Weifeng and the others are also battle-hardened veterans. They are experienced and knowledgeable. Theoretically, there should not be any problem with their mental qualities.</seg>
<seg id="9"> This time, the Chinese team was regrettably pressed to tie with the Iranian team. The reason was probably the ineffectiveness in moving players on the field.</seg>
<seg id="10"> The Iranian team substituted two people while they were trailing behind and the situation was immediately improved.</seg>
<seg id="11"> The Chinese team also substituted three players in the second half but the outcome was not good.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> In order to overcome the problem of not seeing things through, one must find the root of the problem.</seg>
<seg id="13"> As long as one identifies the problem, means to resolve it is probably not hard to find.</seg>
<seg id="14"> The only worrisome thing is to try to find a cure indiscriminately for an emergency.</seg>
<seg id="15"> If the situation continues like this, no matter how many more games the Chinese team plays, it will still commit the same mistake. The continuous progress that people expect as it plays more games will be out of the question.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, London, July 2 - Icelandic scientists' research revealed that people who have two gene mutations in their bodies have a much higher risk of suffering from atrial fibrillation than normal people do.</seg>
<seg id="3"> According to report of the latest issue of the journal Nature, researchers of Iceland-based deCODE Genetics Inc. obtained the above finding after conducting screening of genes of several thousand people from Iceland, Sweden, the United States, and China's Hong Kong region.</seg>
<seg id="4"> The two genes discovered by the scientists are located close to a gene that plays an important role in early heart development.</seg>
<seg id="5"> Atrial fibrillation is the quivering of the heart. It is one of the most common types of clinical cardiac arrhythmia that can cause heart palpitations, shortness of breath, fatigue, and stroke.</seg>
<seg id="6"> In addition, according to report of the Nature Genetics journal published on the 1st, researchers of deCODE Genetics Inc. also identified two genes that link to prostate cancer on human chromosome 17. They play certain role in more than one third of prostate cancer cases.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The study also found that while one of the genes can raise people's risk of prostate cancer, it also lowers their risk of type II diabetes.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Xinhua News Agency, Maracaibo (Venezuela), July 3 (Reporter Liu Jian)</seg>
<seg id="3"> According to report of Venezuelan media on the 3rd, during an interview here, the 37-year-old veteran goalkeeper of the U.S. team Keller stated that if he cannot find a suitable club to play for after the Copa America, then he will choose to retire.</seg>
<seg id="4"> "If four or six weeks after the Copa America ends I still can't strike a deal with a top level football team that would allow me to play another season or two then retirement may be a good choice."</seg>
<seg id="5"> With Moenchengladbach relegated to Germany's Second Division, Keller also left the team that he had played for for more than two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Even though Keller intends to retire, he, who is "yet to be married off", apparently is not worried about the next employer. He said frankly himself that currently, as many as eight clubs intend to invite him to join them.</seg>
<seg id="7"> However, the veteran goalkeeper, who had played in the Spain's First Division League, the English Premier League, and the Germany's First Division League, stated that his final decision rests on his family, "My child is nine years old already and he followed me to three different countries and studied in three different schools. My choice now must seek what's the best for my family."</seg>
<seg id="8"> In the Gold Cup Final that just ended recently, Keller had a stellar performance and helped the U.S. team won the championship.</seg>
<seg id="9"> In the Copa America this year, he was still entrusted with important task by head coach Bradley. However, one man alone cannot win. The U.S. team, which went to battle with "young guards", was simply no match for strong South American teams such as Argentina and Paraguay. The goal that he kept was penetrated seven times in two games.</seg>
<seg id="10"> The next game against the Colombian team will very probably be the last performance of the U.S. team and Keller in this year's Copa America.</seg>

</p>

<seg id="3"> The manager of On Pedder, a well-known store located in the high-end Plaza Indonesia, said: "In the light of the events in Hong Kong, we have canceled the sale of environmentally-friendly bags.</seg>
<seg id="4"> If the public is going to brawl over a 140000-rupiah (about 494 NTD) bag, then it's not worth that."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Thousands of Hong Kong residents gathered outside the shop selling them on the 6th, ready to scramble for the limited-edition, environmentally-friendly bags, which were designed by British designer Anya Hindmarch and are printed with "I am not a plastic bag."  But the shop staff refused to open the doors, causing the situation to get out of control.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> These top-end products, aimed at protecting the environment, are attempting to replace plastic bags, and unexpectedly became a fashion symbol instantly in London and New York.

</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The penalty order shows that the China Council for the Promotion of Area Development committed the following illegal activities: 1) collecting membership fees higher than the standards; 2) using membership fee receipts to collect other fees from non-member organizations.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Investigations revealed that the council's standard for organization membership fees was 2000 yuan per year.  From June 2005 to February 2007, the council issued membership fee receipts to a total of over 20 organizations.  Apart from collecting the membership fees of 2000 yuan from one member organization, it collected from each of the other organizations the membership fees ranging from 10000 yuan to 100000 yuan.  This made a total of over 800000 yuan, including management and other fees collected from branch organizations and internal organizations.  This seriously contravened the relevant laws.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Germany Plans to Lower Threshold for Bringing in Professionals</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Staff Writer, Berlin, July 1 (Correspondent Wang Huaicheng)</seg>
<seg id="3"> German Federal Minister of Education and Research Schavan said recently that Germany should lower the qualifying conditions for bringing in foreign professionals in the Immigration Law and solve the problem of the shortage of professionals that Germany is facing through increasing the recruitment of foreign talents.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> According to a report by OECD, by 2010 the number of workers between age 15 and 64 in Germany will be gradually decreasing each year.</seg>
<seg id="5"> If there are not enough immigrants, the labor force in Germany in 2020 will decrease by 6% as compared with the present.</seg>
<seg id="6"> However, reports by organizations such as the German Employers Association and the German Association of Engineers show that there is a relatively large shortage of engineers and professionals in the current job market in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="7"> According to the statistics from Germany's Federal Labor Department, this May, the supply of engineers in the labor market in Germany had a shortfall of about 12700 people and the supply of technicians had a shortfall of about 9600 people.</seg>
<seg id="8"> In order to protect native employment, Germany has set a relatively high threshold for bringing in foreign talents.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Germany's Immigration Law stipulates that professionals from non-EU countries should have annual salaries of no less than € 85500 in Germany, otherwise they cannot get the permit to work and live in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="10"> Schavan suggests that this qualifying amount be reduced to 40000 to € 60000.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> On July 1, the Eternal Warning Bell in the Memorial Hall of Nanjing's Jinghai Temple was tolled once again, the sound of the bell ringing melodiously.</seg>
<seg id="3"> This rich echo of history connected the mainland and Hong Kong via television, as the citizens of Nanjing and Hong Kong compatriots "shared the same occasion from the far corners of the earth" and celebrated together the tenth anniversary of Hong Kong's reversion to the motherland.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Ten years previously, at 12:00 a.m. on July 1, the sound of the tolling of the Eternal Warning Bell reverberated 155 times in the sky over the bell tower of the Memorial Hall of Nanjing's Jinghai Temple, bidding farewell to the humiliating history of the cession of Hong Kong island.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> People from all walks of life in Nanjing society gathered together in front of the gate of the smallish Memorial Hall.  They said that they wanted to give an eternal warning to themselves and to later generations not to forget history by ringing this Eternal Warning Bell with their own two hands.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> "The bell of the Eternal Warning Bell is 1.842 meters high, and the year 1842 was precisely when the 'Nanjing Treaty' was concluded at the time of the eruption of the Opium War.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The shoulder of the bell is 1.997 meters high, and 1997 was the year of Hong Kong's reversion."</seg>
<seg id="8"> The man behind the devising and casting of the Eternal Warning Bell that year, Wang Fengling, explained that "there are five 'wan' character inscriptions around the body of the bell.  The whole copper bell is in high relief, with two dragons supporting a fireball, symbolizing the fact that Hong Kong is the motherland's 'Pearl of the Orient.'  Finally, Nanjing's city flower, the plum blossom, forms the pattern on the body of the bell where the bell is struck."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Yu Xiaodong, a member of the Democratic Party and the first person back then to propose the construction of the Eternal Warning Bell sighed with emotion, saying, "Before we knew it, it has been ten years already since the reversion of Hong Kong."  He hopes that Hong Kong's tomorrow could be like the sound of that tolling bell, "resounding and melodious, ongoing and everlasting."</seg>

<seg id="1"> Three Main Functions of Modern Military Uniform</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The first is the identification function.</seg>
<seg id="3"> It is an important sign that distinguishes the armies of different countries, different military services, and between the military and civilians.</seg>
<seg id="4"> In the armies of more than 100 large and small countries of the world, although the use of military uniform is basically identical, there are no two countries' armies whose military uniforms are completely the same.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The second is the symbolic function.</seg>
<seg id="6"> To a certain extent, military uniform is both a reflection of a country's mental outlook and its national characteristics, and is also a concentrated embodiment of a country's military ability to wage war and the quality of its servicemen.</seg>
<seg id="7"> In the three main types of military uniform -- ceremonial attire, everyday uniforms, and drill uniforms -- the one that can express national prestige and military prestige to the fullest extent is none other than ceremonial attire that is well-pressed and pleasing to the eye.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The third is the protective function.</seg>
<seg id="9"> With the rapid development of high-tech and updated weaponry, improving the overall protective capacity of new-style drill uniforms to give military uniform various types of functions -- including bulletproofing, stealth protection, anti-chemical, anti-bacterial and anti-radiation functions, as well as control of the temperature, humidity and the air -- has become a key issue in the development of military uniform.</seg>

<seg id="1"> A Brigade Party Committee Organ Has the Courage to Handle Thorny Issues Properly</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Staff Writer, Chengdu, July 3</seg>
<seg id="3"> Report by Qu Yimao and Yang Ruiyu: "We can now move into apartments as a result of the brigade party committee organ's resolution and boldness in freeing up the apartments."</seg>
<seg id="4"> Today, more than ten cadres in a communications drill brigade in Chengdu Military Command were all beaming with pleasure as they moved into apartments.  They felt full of admiration and gratitude for the way the "group" on the brigade party committee dared to confront tough obstacles in solving thorny issues.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Over the past few years, along with the replacement of personnel, an excessive part of the brigade's accommodation for family members had been occupied against regulations, making it difficult to house the cadres on active duty.  Officers and men had quite strong views about this.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The brigade had tried to free up the apartments several times, but failed to get it done each time due to all kinds of obstruction, allowing the problem to become a long-standing, big and difficult issue.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> "As long as we have the courage to do things properly and are fair and reasonable, there are no difficulties we cannot solve."</seg>
<seg id="8"> After the group on the new party committee had reached a consensus, the principal leaders appeared in person and set about thoroughly sorting out all the problems relating to occupation of apartments against regulations.</seg>
<seg id="9"> On the one hand they appealed to people's emotions and explained their reasoning, hoping that the personnel concerned would consider the whole picture; on the other hand, they explained the policies and regulations relating to military apartments, apartments built with pooled money, and economical and adequate apartments, to show the party committee's staunch determination and principled stance.</seg>
<seg id="10"> In the case of personnel who had accommodation elsewhere and were not willing to leave the additional apartments they occupied, the party committee organ promptly made contact with the work units they were in and adopted relevant measures to encourage them to take the initiative in cooperating with the work of the army.</seg>
<seg id="11"> Over two months of meticulous work, all residents occupying additional apartments in the army barracks against regulations had all moved out on schedule, and cadres who worked in the brigade were all assigned the accommodation in accordance with regulations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The way in which this brigade party committee dared to confront tough obstacles has also given rise to a chain reaction.  Several cadres who originally were unwilling to actively cooperate with the organization's allotment have now one by one also expressed their willingness to obey the organization's decisions.</seg>

<seg id="3"> Report by Li Guoliang and Huang Qi: For many years, Guangdong's Frontier Defense Unit Hospital, while doing a good job ensuring army medical service, has also done all it can to aid the masses who have found themselves in straitened circumstances, their compassion soothing the hearts of the common people everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="4"> This morning, a celebratory meeting to mark the conferring by the Public Security Ministry of a Collective Ward of Merit, Second Class, on Guangdong's Frontier Defense Unit Hospital, together with a public lecture on the exemplary deeds of the army in supporting the government and cherishing the people, was solemnly held in Shenzhen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The Guangdong Frontier Unit Hospital, which has set itself the task of building socialist harmony, has successively established three fair-price hospitals specially aimed at migrant laborers in Buji, Longhua and Bao'an of Shenzhen.  The registration fee for migrant laborers seeking medical advice is only 1 yuan, and discounts of 20% are available for both tests and operations.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The hospital is provided with a special "Compassionate Service Vehicle," which takes peasant migrant patients to and from the clinic free of charge, and has rolled out a migrant peasant worker "Health Service Card," whereby each person needs to pay just 7 yuan a month to enjoy 12 types of basic medical treatment consultations and guarantees.</seg>
<seg id="7"> These measures to benefit the people have already been extended to more than 12000 migrant peasant workers.</seg>
</p>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> At the "Practical Research into the Selection and Cultivation of New Plant Varieties for the Summer Olympics" project evaluation meeting held on the 28th in Beijing, the experts making the evaluation came to the conclusion that by the use of new rapid-control cultivation technologies, plant species or varieties with different natural flowering seasons could blossom at the same time in the summer and reach an optimum result for people to enjoy in August when the Beijing Olympics are held.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> In the summer in Beijing, one can usually see only a dozen or so fresh flowers in full bloom, as the majority of flowering plants have either long withered or are far away from blossoming.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The scientific and research personnel worked hard to select 206 species and more than 400 varieties of plants for the Summer Olympic Games.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> BERLIN, July 1, by the news paper (Reporter Wang Huaicheng)</seg>
<seg id="3"> German Minister of Education and Research Schavan said the other day that Germany should lower the conditions in its Immigration Law regarding the attraction of foreign professional talents, so as to address the shortage of professional talents that Germany faces by attracting more foreign talents.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> According to an OECD report, workforce aged between 15 and 64 will decreases every year in Germany by 2010.</seg>
<seg id="5"> If there are not enough immigrants, then by 2020, German workforce will have been 6% less than the current level.</seg>
<seg id="6"> Reports of organizations such as the Confederation of German Employers' Associations and the German Engineers Association show that there is a fairly large shortage of engineers and professional technicians in the current German labor market.</seg>
<seg id="7"> According to statistics of the German Federal Labor Agency, in May this year, the shortage of supply was 12700 for engineers and 9600 for technicians in the German labor market.</seg>
<seg id="8"> Germany has set relatively high threshold of attracting foreign talents in order to protect employment of its citizens.</seg>
<seg id="9"> Under Germany's Immigration Law, professional talents from non-EU countries cannot get work and resident permits unless their annual income in Germany is no lower than € 85500.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> On July 1, the Warning Bell at Jinghai Temple Memorial in Nanjing was struck again, giving melodious bell strokes.</seg>
<seg id="3"> The sophisticated echo of history "connected" the mainland and Hong Kong through a TV channel, so that Nanjing citizens and Hong Kong compatriots "shared the moments across the land" to celebrate together the 10th anniversary of Hong Kong's return to the motherland.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> At 12:00am July 1 ten years ago, the bell tower at Jinghai Temple Memorial in Nanjing was reverberated with 155 strokes of the Warning Bell, which bid farewell to the humiliating history of ceding the Hong Kong Island.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> People from various social circles of Nanjing gathered outside the modest-sized memorial entrance. They said they would strike the Warning Bell with their own hands, to warn themselves and offspring not to forget the history.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> "The Warning Bell is 1.842 meters tall, and 1842 is just the year in which the Nanjing Treaty was signed during the Opium War.</seg>
<seg id="7"> The bell shoulder is 1.997 meters tall, and 1997 is the year in which Hong Kong returned."</seg>
<seg id="8"> Wang Fengling, past planner and creator of the Warning Bell explained, "five strings of 'swastikas' surround the bell body. The entire copper bell is in high relief, with two dragons holding up a fire ball, which symbolizes Hong Kong as the "oriental pearl" of the motherland. Last, Nanjing's city flower, the plum flower, is used as the striking pattern on the bell body."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Yu Xiaodong, who is a democratic party member and the first to propose the creation of the Warning Bell back in those years, exclaimed, "without us knowing it, it has been ten years since Hong Kong's return." He hoped Hong Kong's future could be "bright, melodious and endless" just like the bell stokes.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Three Major Functions of Modern Military Uniforms</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> First is the identifying function,</seg>
<seg id="3"> an important symbol to distinguish among armies of different nations, among different armed services, and between troops and civilians.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Although the purposes of military uniforms are basically the same in the armed forces of some 100 nations big or small around the world, no armed forces of any two nations have identical military uniforms.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Second is the symbolizing function.</seg>
<seg id="6"> To some extent, military uniforms not only reflect a country's vitality and national characteristics, but also centrally showcases the combating capabilities and servicemen qualities of a country's armed forces.</seg>
<seg id="7"> Of the three major categories of military uniforms, dress uniforms, service uniforms and combat &amp; training uniforms, nothing is more able to fully demonstrate the might of a country and its military than the neat and elegant dress uniforms.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Third is the protective function.</seg>
<seg id="9"> With the rapid development of new and high-tech weapons, it has become a paramount issue in the development of military uniforms to improve the comprehensive protective performance of new combat &amp; training uniforms, so that military uniforms have various functions, such as protecting from bullets, reconnaissance, chemistry, bacteria and radiation, as well as conditioning the temperature, humidity and air.</seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> CHENGDU, July 3, by the newspaper</seg>
<seg id="3"> By Qu Yimao and Yang Ruiyu: "The fact that we can live in an apartment is attributed to the determination and resolution of the battalion's Party committee office to vacate houses."</seg>
<seg id="4"> Today, more than ten cadres of a communications training battalion at the Chengdu Military Region who moved into apartments were all lit up with pleasure, as they were filled with admiration and gratitude for the working style of the "team" at the battalion's Party committee that dare to get serious and meet challenges when tackling thorny problems.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> A few years earlier, with staff changing and being replaced, some homes in the battalion's family dormitory building were over-occupied in violation of rules, which brought housing difficulties to cadres on active service. Both officers and soldiers are quite unhappy over it.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The battalion had tried to vacate the homes several times, but left it unsettled because of various resistance, making this problem a hard nut to crack.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> "So long as we dare to get serious and are reasonable, there are no difficult problems that we can't solve."</seg>
<seg id="8"> Once the new Party committee reached the consensus, principal leaders went out personally to begin a thorough cleanup regarding the problem of irregular housing occupation.</seg>
<seg id="9"> They touched people sentimentally and enlightened them sensibly on the one hand, hoping that those involved could put the overall situation into perspective; on the other hand, they clarified applicable policies and rules of the troops about apartments, pool funded housing and economically affordable housing, expressing the resolute determination and fundamental stance of the Party committee.</seg>
<seg id="10"> For those people who had housing elsewhere, but were reluctant to return the over-occupied housing, the Party committee office made timely contact with their units and took necessary measures to urge them give cooperation to the troops' work on voluntary basis.</seg>
<seg id="11"> After two months of attentive efforts, all tenants in the barrack complex who over-occupied housing in violation of rules moved out on schedule, and the battalion's cadres on active service were all allocated housing in compliance with policies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The working style of the battalion's Party committee that dare to get serious and meet challenges also had chain effects, in that several cadres who were previously reluctant to give active cooperation in the organization's allocation have now said they would follow the organization's decisions.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Three Functions of Modern Army Uniforms</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The first is its identification function.</seg>
<seg id="3"> An important mark to differentiate between armies of different countries, between different services and arms, and between the army and the civilians.</seg>
<seg id="4"> Even though army uniforms have basically the same use among armies of over 100 large and small countries in the world, no army uniforms of any two countries' armies are identical.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The second is its symbolic function.</seg>
<seg id="6"> To a certain extent, army uniform is a reflection of the spirit and distinctive feature of a nation. It also fully reflects the fighting ability and the soldiers' quality of a country's army.</seg>
<seg id="7"> In the three major types of army uniforms - dress uniform, service uniform, and combat and training uniform - there is nothing like the crisp and beautiful dress uniform that can fully display the might of the country and the army.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The third is its protective function.</seg>
<seg id="9"> With the rapid development in new and high-tech weapons and equipment, to enhance the comprehensive protective ability of new and high-tech combat and training uniforms so as to provide army uniforms with various functions including bulletproof, counter-reconnaissance, chemical-proof, germs-proof, radiation-proof, as well as temperature, dampness, and air adjustments has become the priority in the development of army uniforms.</seg>

<seg id="1"> Brigade Party Committee Dares to Handle Difficult Issues with Persistence</seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> This newspaper, Chengdu, July 3</seg>
<seg id="3"> Reported by Qu Yimao, Yang Ruiyu: "We must thank the brigade's Party committee for its determination and courage in the eviction so that we can live in an apartment."</seg>
<seg id="4"> Today, more than 10 cadres of a communication training brigade in Chengdu Military Area Command who moved into apartments were all beaming with joy. They were full of respect and gratitude for the earnest and courageous way "the group" at the brigade Party Committee handled difficult issues.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> A few years ago, with personnel changes, some of the apartments in the residential building of the brigade were illegally occupied which caused a shortage in accommodation for cadres in active service. The officers and soldiers had quite a few complaints about it.</seg>
<seg id="6"> The brigade had tried evictions a few times before but due to various obstructions, nothing was settled every time, thus turning this into a complicated and long-pending problem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> "As long as one is persistent and reasonable, all problems can be resolved."</seg>
<seg id="8"> After the new Party committee group reached a consensus, the key leadership started to thoroughly straighten out all problems of illegal occupation of apartments themselves.</seg>
<seg id="9"> On the one hand, they resorted to emotional appeal through reasoning and hoped that the people involved would consider the big picture. At the same time, they clearly explained relevant policy stipulations on apartments, houses built by collected funds, and utility apartments of the army, and declared the Party committee's determination, principles and position.</seg>
<seg id="10"> For people who had housing elsewhere but were unwilling to return the illegally occupied housing, the Party committee immediately contacted the units to which they belonged and adopted corresponding measures to urge them to voluntarily cooperate with the work of the brigade.</seg>
<seg id="11"> After two months of meticulous work, all residents in the barrack site who had illegally occupied the apartments moved away on time. All cadres in the brigade who were in active service were given housing according to the rule.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The persistent and courageous work style of the brigade Party committee also created a chain effect. The few cadres who were unwilling to positively cooperate with the assignment of the organization in the beginning all indicated that they will follow the decision of the organization now.</seg>
