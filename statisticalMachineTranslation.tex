\chapter{Statistical Machine Translation}

% This is a background chapter on SMT with emphasis on the parts
% that will be extended further for research.

\section{Overview}

% This should be an overview of the translation pipeline.

\section{Word Alignment}

% This should review the IBM models and more specifically
% the HMM and word-to-phrase HMM models.
% Why: using these for extraction from posteriors.

\section{Language Modelling}

% This should review backoff and modified kneser-ney smoothing.
% Why: LM interpolation gains.

\section{Phrase Based Translation}

% This should review phrase based SMT.
% Why: the gyro decoder is like a phrase based SMT decoder.

\section{Hierarchical Phrase Based Translation}

% This should review Hiero and possibly HiFST.
% Why: extraction from posteriors, hadoop/hbase extraction/retrieval.
