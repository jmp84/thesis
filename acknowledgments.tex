\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

First, I would like to thank my supervisor
Prof.\ Bill Byrne.
Bill provided relentless support throughout
my PhD studies.
He taught me to be a better write and a better researcher.
I am grateful that he allowed
me to pause my studies for three months for
an internship at Google.

Without the lab computer officers, Patrick Gosling
and Anna Langley, experiments reported in this thesis
would not have been possible, I am therefore
grateful for all their hard work.

I also wish to thank all my colleagues at
the Machine Intelligence Lab.
Dr.\ Adri√† de Gispert provided me with
critical guidance throughout my research.
I am grateful to Aurelien Waite for all his
help on infrastructure and for helping mebecoming
a better engineer.
Thanks to Dr.\ Gonzalo Iglesias for illuminating
discussions on FSTs for machine translation as well
as C++ software engineering.
Dr.\ Graeme Blackwood and Dr.\ Jamie Brunning
provided a lot of support at the start of my studies as
well as very useful background translation tools.

I am also in debt to my office collegues Matt Shannon, Matt Seigel
and Chao Zhang for making PhD studies a pleasurable experience.

Finally, I would like to thank Anna for her patience, her guidance and
her support, as well as Sofia and Fania for their happiness.
