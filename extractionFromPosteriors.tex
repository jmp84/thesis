\chapter{Hierarchical Rule Extraction from Alignment Posterior Probabilities}

\section{Introduction and Motivation}

Word alignment models are used to generate alignment links between
the source and the target sentences in the training data. These
alignment links then provide constraints to extract translation
rules. Thus statistics provided by the word alignment models are
not used by translation models further down the pipeline.
Our goal is tighter coupling between the alignment models and the
translation models.

The word-to-word HMM alignment model provides alignment links
posterior probabilities as well as phrase pair posterior
probabilities. Conceptually, we want to extract all possible phrase pairs given
a sentence pair and select only the ones that verify certain statistical
criteria related to link and phrase pair posterior probabilities. For
example, we can select phrase pairs that contain a link with a high posterior.
Or we can select phrase pairs that contain a link with a high posterior
and that have a high phrase pair posterior. These criteria allow us
to have control over the richness of the grammar. The probabilities
also allow us to give more fine-grained estimates of the translation
models.

We evaluate the grammar obtained in two ways. First, we measure
its expressive power by measuring how often a sentence pair
can be regenerated. Second, we measure translation quality.
